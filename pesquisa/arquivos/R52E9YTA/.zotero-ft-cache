Abstract and Figures
This study investigates the impact of website usability and mobile optimization on customer satisfaction and sales conversion rates in e-commerce businesses in Indonesia. Utilizing a quantitative approach, data were collected from 170 respondents using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS 3). The results indicate that all hypothesized relationships are positive and significant. Specifically, improvements in website usability and mobile optimization significantly enhance customer satisfaction, which in turn positively influences the sales conversion rate. The findings underscore the critical importance of optimizing website usability and mobile interfaces to boost customer satisfaction and drive higher sales conversions in the competitive e-commerce landscape of Indonesia.
Internal Assessment Model e. Model Fit Model fit indices provide a measure of how well the proposed model fits the observed data. The following results detail the model fit statistics for the Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS 3) analysis conducted in this study: The Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR), a measure of the difference between the observed correlation and the modelimplied correlation matrix, is 0.057, well below the threshold of 0.08, indicating a good fit (Hu & Bentler, 1999). The Normed Fit Index (NFI), which assesses model fit by comparing the chi-square value of the model to the chi-square of the null model, is 0.921, close to 1, suggesting a significantly better fit compared to the null model. The Chi-Square/df ratio, which is the chi-square fit index
