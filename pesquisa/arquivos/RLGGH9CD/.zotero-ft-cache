1. Introduction
The digital landscape has transformed the way commerce operates, with an increasing reliance
on online platforms for buying and selling goods and services [1]. As e-commerce continues to
flourish, businesses are confronted with the challenge of not only attracting a substantial volume
of traffic to their websites but, more importantly, converting that traffic into meaningful
transactions [2]. The journey from clicks to conversions represents a critical juncture in the success
of any e-commerce venture.
Understanding the diverse sources that drive traffic to e-commerce websites is paramount for
businesses seeking to optimize their online presence [3]. From organic search results and paid
advertisements to social media referrals and direct visits, each traffic source carries its unique set
of implications for conversion rates. This paper delves into the intricate relationship between these
traffic sources and the goal of e-commerce: the conversion of visitors into customers.
The analysis of traffic sources in e-commerce is not merely an exercise in data interpretation;
it is a strategic imperative. As businesses navigate a dynamic and competitive online marketplace,
decoding the patterns and behaviors associated with different traffic sources becomes essential for
informed decision-making [4]. This paper aims to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by
providing a comprehensive examination of the impact of various traffic sources on conversion
rates, offering insights that can guide e-commerce businesses in crafting effective strategies.
In the pages that follow, we will explore the existing literature on e-commerce traffic sources,
outline our methodology for data collection and analysis, categorize and describe different types
of traffic sources, and present findings that shed light on the factors influencing conversions. By
the end of this exploration, we aspire to equip businesses with actionable recommendations for
optimizing their traffic sources and, consequently, enhancing their conversion rates in the dynamic
world of e-commerce.
2. Literature Review
In the age of digital media, the management of customer journeys in e-commerce has become
a complex task due to the vast digital information sources accessible to consumers. Klein et al.
(2020) [5] address the challenge of quantifying customers' cross-media exposure and its impact on
individual customer journeys. They introduce "media entropy" as a metric, drawing on information
and signaling theory, to measure the entropy of company-controlled and peer-driven media
sources. Through a probit model analysis, they demonstrate that cross-media exposure


3
significantly influences purchase decisions, especially in digital environments, for customers not
currently owning the brand and for perceived weaker brands.
Kakalejčík, Bucko, and Danko (2020) [6] contribute to the understanding of online customer
journeys by investigating the impact of newly created brand awareness on buying behavior.
Analyzing over 280,000 online customer journeys from Slovakian e-commerce stores, they
introduce the concept of "direct traffic effect" based on theoretical brand awareness criteria. Their
findings reveal that these criteria significantly contribute to the company's revenues, emphasizing
the importance of positive customer experiences in the early stages of interactions online.
Duan and Zhang (2021) [7] focus on the evaluation of the effectiveness and return on
investment (ROI) across different referral channels in e-commerce. Employing the vector
autoregressive (VARX) model on a large-scale clickstream dataset, they explore the dynamics and
interdependencies among search engines, social media, and third-party websites. Their findings
highlight the immediate and cumulative effects of social media referrals on conversion rates,
providing valuable insights for digital marketing managers assessing the economic value of online
referral channels.
Cao, Chu, Hui, and Xu (2021) [8] contribute to the understanding of online marketing
strategies by examining the relationship between referral marketing and price promotion. Their
research on a large e-commerce platform reveals that although referral marketing increases sales,
its effectiveness is attenuated by price promotion. The study emphasizes the need for marketing
managers to scrutinize the complementarity of promotional strategies, especially in addressing
consumers' quality concerns in the online environment.
Zumstein and Kotowski (2020) [9] provide practical insights into the success factors of e
commerce by offering ten recommendations for online shops. These recommendations range from
offering free shipping and personalized content to analyzing digital analytics data. The study
emphasizes the importance of building trust, personalizing user experiences, and leveraging
various sales and marketing channels for effective e-commerce operations.
Azoev and Khokhlov (2022) [10] delve into the intricacies of site-based conversion, with a
particular focus on identifying criteria for the fundamental conversion of a website, independent
of advertising campaign elements. The study addresses challenges related to the accuracy of media
plans and proposes a classification of advertising traffic sources. By calculating conversion
rejection coefficients for different advertising formats, the authors aim to empower media planners


4
to develop more accurate plans, minimizing the need for experimental campaigns. This
contribution sheds light on the factors influencing conversion rates and sets the stage for further
research to enhance the precision of media plans in the digital landscape.
Spais (2010) [11] explores the extension of Bedny's [12] perspective of 'activity' theory as a
framework for understanding and analyzing new online promotion channels, specifically search
engines. The conceptualization of activity theory is applied to Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
contextual issues, providing insights into the design and analysis of SEO promotion techniques.
The findings contribute to the literature by offering practical implications for promotion managers
seeking to navigate the dynamic landscape of SEO as an online promotion technique.
Kang et al. (2021) [13] delve into the unexplored dynamics of live streaming commerce,
emphasizing interactivity's impact on customer engagement. The study, guided by the stimulus
organism-response (S-O-R) framework, identifies a curvilinear relationship between interactivity
and customer engagement. Tie strength emerges as a key mediator, showcasing the nuanced role
of user interactions in the context of live streaming commerce platforms.
Rosário and Raimundo (2021) [14] underscore the transformative influence of technological
developments. The study explores how user-friendly design features on e-commerce websites
enhance interactivity and engagement. The integration of social networking sites (SNSs) fosters
two-way communication, enabling information sharing and innovation. Moreover, the integration
of IT and big data technologies enables personalization and customization, ensuring the
adaptability of e-commerce businesses in a competitive global landscape.
Sakas and Giannakopoulos (2021) [15] delve into the significance of mobile and desktop
device usage in shaping the digital brand name of airline firms. The research underscores the
impact of these devices on organic, referral, and direct traffic, providing insights into the nuanced
effects of mobile and desktop usage on airlines' digital brand name.
Dolega et al. (2021) [16] contribute to the understanding of social media's impact on business
outcomes using a major online retailer's data. Findings highlight that while social media increases
web traffic, its influence on product orders and sales is limited. Larger campaigns, especially on
Facebook, yield higher orders and sales, emphasizing the nuanced effectiveness of social media
marketing that varies based on campaign size and product characteristics.
Hasan et al. (2009) [17] identified thirteen web metrics as indicators of potential usability
problems on e-commerce websites, providing a quick, easy, and cost-effective overview. While


5
these metrics offer continual insights into a site's usability, the authors emphasized the need for
additional techniques, such as heuristic evaluation, for a thorough understanding of specific issues.
They proposed a future research framework incorporating Google Analytics (GA) to identify
usability problems swiftly and inexpensively, complemented by heuristic evaluation for detailed
analysis.
These studies collectively contribute to the understanding of conversion in e-commerce,
exploring the impact of advertising traffic sources on conversion rates and presenting an innovative
application of activity theory to the realm of Search Engine Optimization. As the digital marketing
landscape evolves, these insights become crucial for practitioners and researchers alike, offering
valuable perspectives for the development of effective promotion strategies in the online domain.
3. Methodology
3.1. Research Design
This research adopts a retrospective study design, leveraging data extracted from the
Google Analytics platform. This approach allows for a systematic examination of historical
data, enabling a detailed analysis of user behavior patterns over time. By focusing on past
user interactions, the study aims to uncover insights into the website's performance and

3.2. Data Source
Our study relies on Google Analytics as the primary data source, a web analytics tool
known for its capability to capture detailed metrics associated with user interactions. This
encompasses critical metrics, including landing page interactions, bounce rates, exit rates,
and conversion data. Google Analytics was chosen for its robust features, providing a
comprehensive dataset essential for the in-depth analysis of user behavior on the e
commerce website. The platform's capacity to capture nuanced user behavior makes it an
ideal source for this investigation.
3.3. Duration of the Study
Data used spans a two-year period, providing a longitudinal perspective for evaluating
trends, patterns, and user behaviors. The extended duration allows for a thorough
examination of potential seasonality and long-term dynamics in user engagement.
3.4. Key Metrics Definitions
 Bounce Rate


6
The bounce rate, a crucial metric, is computed as the number of sessions where users
entered the site and immediately left divided by the total number of sessions [18]. A high
bounce rate may signal issues related to user expectations, SEO, or landing page
functionality. Analyzing this metric aids in pinpointing potential areas of improvement.
 Exit Rate
The exit rate, calculated as the number of sessions where users navigated to a page and
then exited the site divided by the total number of sessions, provides insights into user
interactions with specific pages. Elevated exit rates may indicate issues with page content,
functionality, or overall user experience, guiding optimization efforts.
 Conversion Rate
The conversion rate, a pivotal metric, represents the percentage of sessions resulting in a
completed transaction. This metric is fundamental for evaluating the effectiveness of the
website's conversion process. Understanding conversion rates allows for targeted
enhancements to optimize the user journey.
3.5. Query Execution
Customized queries were formulated to extract pertinent data from the Google Analytics
dataset. These queries specifically targeted elements such as traffic mediums, browsers,
devices, and essential metrics like sessions, exit rates, transactions, and conversion rates.
3.6. Analysis Techniques
 Descriptive Analysis
A descriptive analysis was conducted on the extracted data to provide a comprehensive
overview of key metrics. This step aimed to establish a foundational understanding of
the e-commerce website's overall performance.
 Comparative Analysis
Comparative analysis explored variations in bounce rates, exit rates, and conversion
rates across different dimensions such as landing pages, browsers, devices, and traffic
sources, providing actionable insights for improvement.
 Conversion Path Analysis
Tracing the customer's conversion path involved a detailed examination of user
behavior from landing pages to checkout. This analysis included scrutinizing the
progression of users through product details, checkout, and purchase completion.


7
Identifying potential bottlenecks in the conversion process is helpful for strategic
optimizations.
 User Engagement Analysis Across Devices
Analysis was conducted to uncover specific issues related to user engagement across
various devices, including tablets, desktops, and mobiles. This qualitative approach
aimed to identify issues at the browser, device, page, form, and button levels, offering
nuanced insights into the user experience and guiding responsive design improvements.
3.7. Data Visualization
The findings from the analysis were effectively visualized using plots and charts. This
visualization facilitated a clear and interpretable representation of insights gained from the
data, aiding in the communication of key findings.
4. Findings
Figure 1 displays the bounce rates for the website's top 10 pages, while Figure 2 illustrates
their exit rates. The "Men's Apparel" page exhibits a lower bounce rate, suggesting users engage
with its content. However, Figure 2 reveals a higher exit rate for the same page. This indicates that,
despite initial engagement, a significant portion of visitors exit the website after interacting with
the page. The discrepancy between bounce and exit rates signals potential challenges in the user
journey or conversion process, warranting further investigation for optimization.
Figure 3 presents an overview of exit rates and sessions categorized by different devices. The
analysis reveals that mobile devices exhibit an exit rate notably higher than other devices. This
suggests a potential optimization opportunity for mobile viewing. Most sessions are from desktop
users, indicating the need to explore potential reasons for the higher exit rate on mobile.
Figure 4 illustrates the distribution of sessions and exit rates across various browsers. Chrome
dominates in sessions, with a comparatively lower exit rate, while Safari and Firefox exhibit higher
exit rates.
The conversion rate is a crucial indicator for businesses to understand the effectiveness of their
marketing efforts and the user experience on their platforms. It provides insights into the
percentage of sessions that result in completed transactions, which is a key factor in determining
the success of an online business [19]. Figure 5 presents the conversion rates across different traffic
mediums, highlighting the varying performance of each medium in terms of converting user
sessions into completed transactions. The conversion rate (CR) formula is expressed as:


8
ൌ ܴܥ
ݏ݊݋݅ݐܿܽݏ݊ܽݎܶ ݄ݐ݅ݓ ݏ݊݋݅ݏݏ݁ܵ ݂݋ ݎܾ݁݉ݑܰ ݏ݊݋݅ݏݏ݁ܵ ݂݋ ݎܾ݁݉ݑܰ ݈ܽݐ݋ܶ
ൈ 100
The data indicates that the CPM (Cost Per Mille) medium, followed by CPC (Cost Per Click),
demonstrates higher conversion rates. This suggests that users coming from these traffic sources
are more likely to complete transactions compared to other mediums. On the other hand, referral
and affiliate traffic exhibit lower conversion rates, indicating potential areas for improvement in
engaging and converting users from these sources.
Figure 6 illustrates the conversion path, showing the progression of users through various
actions leading up to a completed purchase. It is notable that a significant number of users proceed
from product detail views to the checkout stage, indicating active interest in making a purchase.
However, only a fraction of these users completes the purchase, pointing towards potential barriers
or challenges in the final stages of the conversion process.
The most common user action observed is “Click through of product lists,” indicating
active engagement with the products offered. On the other hand, “Completed purchase” is
identified as the least common action, suggesting that there may be obstacles hindering users from
finalizing their purchases.
This analysis of conversion rates and user behavior provides valuable insights for
businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and user experience. By understanding which
traffic mediums perform better in terms of conversions and identifying potential bottlenecks in the
conversion path, businesses can make informed decisions to enhance their overall conversion rates
and ultimately drive more successful transactions.
5. Discussion
Based on the data provided in Figures 3 and 4, there are several optimization opportunities
to improve user experience and conversion rates. For mobile devices, which have a higher exit
rate, it is essential to identify the reasons for this trend. Possible factors could include slow loading
times, poor user interface design, or lack of mobile optimization. Addressing these issues could
lead to a decrease in the mobile exit rate and an increase in overall user engagement. For browsers,
the higher exit rates on Safari and Firefox compared to Chrome suggest that there might be
compatibility issues or performance differences between these browsers and the website.
Investigating these discrepancies and implementing necessary changes can help improve user
experience and reduce exit rates across all browsers. The observed progression rate from product


9
details to the checkout page highlights the importance of product presentation and customer
engagement strategies employed by e-commerce platforms. However, the relatively lower
conversion rate from the checkout page to completed purchases raises questions about the
platform’s ability to effectively convert user interest into actual transactions.
This study’s findings indicate a potential disconnect between the initial interest in product
details and the ultimate commitment to making a transaction. It is crucial for e-commerce
platforms to understand and address these gaps to optimize user engagement and improve
conversion rates. Moving forward, future work could focus on refining the user experience and
addressing specific challenges identified in this analysis. Conducting more extensive user testing,
especially on mobile devices, will be instrumental in uncovering issues and guiding targeted
improvements. Implementing A/B testing on the checkout page may shed light on factors
influencing the observed lower conversion rates, facilitating data-driven optimizations. This
continuous refinement process aims to align the e-commerce platform with evolving user
expectations and industry standards.
6. Conclusion
This analysis of user interactions and conversion metrics provides valuable insights for
optimizing the e-commerce platform. The higher exit rates observed on mobile devices underscore
the necessity for targeted improvements in mobile optimization, loading times, and user interface
design. Addressing these concerns is aidful in ensuring a seamless user experience. Compatibility
issues across different browsers, particularly on Safari and Firefox, require further investigation
and implementation of necessary adjustments to enhance cross-browser performance.
The conversion rate analysis showed the varying effectiveness of different traffic mediums.
Advertised sources (CPM and CPC) exhibit higher conversion rates, while referral and affiliate
traffic present opportunities for improvement. Examining the user journey from product details to
checkout revealed potential bottlenecks in the concluding stages of the conversion process. The
identified disconnect between user interest and completed transactions signals the need for
strategic enhancements in the checkout process, aiming to streamline and facilitate user
transactions.
Our study underscores the significance of analyzing user engagement within e-commerce
platforms to pinpoint potential gaps between initial interest and ultimate commitment.
Recognizing these disconnects enables e-commerce platforms to devise strategies that enhance


10
user engagement and improve conversion rates, fostering a more successful online shopping
experience for consumers. The insights garnered from this analysis empower businesses to refine
their platforms and align them more closely with user expectations, ultimately contributing to
sustained growth and competitiveness in the digital marketplace.
