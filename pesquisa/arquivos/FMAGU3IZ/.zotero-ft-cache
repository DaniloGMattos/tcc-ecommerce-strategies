Abstract
Proposing and implementing software systems, especially web applications for e-commerce
using the traditional monolithic approach has been the norm, however, as new user
requirements force organisations and developers to add more functionalities to their systems,
and as user demands increases, the performance of monolith applications decreases, and
maintenance costs rise. These issues have necessitated a need for a better system and that is
where Microservices event-driven applications come in. This thesis investigates the scope
and impact of migrating to Microservices, using agile frameworks, and bi-modal IT
strategy. To obtain quantitative data for analysis, prototypes of monolith and microservice
websites were integrated with Dropwizard, an open source metrics, and Apache JMeter, and
response time and error rate readings were collected. Results showed that monoliths have a
faster response time when the number of user request calls is within tolerant range, better
than Microservices, but as complexity grows over time and there is increased user request
calls, Microservices appears to perform better.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Microservices is getting more popular in recent years, and many companies and agencies are
migrating their monolith applications to microservices event-driven architecture. This
architecture allows developers to independently develop and deploy services and ease the
adoption of agile process. On the other hand, using agile frameworks with monolith
architecture is very difficult as teams experience challenges collaborating on a single
application at the same time. Ironically, many companies are still hesitant to migrate because
they think microservices is a hype or because they are not aware of the migration process and
the benefits and matters related to migration. For this reason, this research intends to build basic
monolith and microservice prototypes and conduct experiments to measure their metrics that
can be analysed to investigate the scope and impact of microservices compared to monoliths.
1.1 Problem Statement
Many business enterprises, companies and government agencies that adopt IT as critical
part of their daily operations still depend on traditional or legacy architecture software although
most of the components are becoming obsolete and incur about 80 percent of the IT
department’s operational costs (Newman, 2017). They find it difficult to apply modern IT
practices such as Agile frameworks as it is difficult for a team of developers to work
collaboratively on a traditional legacy or monolith architected software, thereby causing
maintenance to become more difficult. Salescache, an online discounts shop is one example of
several companies whose enterprise system was build using the monolith approach. It resulted
in the system being tightly coupled; difficult to maintain, and the entire system needing to be
rebuilt using the event-driven architecture framework. However, findings show that many
companies are sceptical in migrating to the microservices event-driven, not because they don't
embrace the new technology and the benefit agility offers, but because they don't understand


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
2
how to migrate while ensuring little or no disruption to the old system (Purcell, 2017). There
is also the problem of financial aspects of migrating to microservices as managed services in
public cloud platforms have very different pricing models, and the choice of a microservice
runtime or data storage solution can have a significant impact on the cost-effectiveness of
running a microservice system in the cloud. These issues inspired this research work to attempt
and investigate the efficiency of event-driven architecture compared to the traditional
architecture, analyse the scope and impact of migrating, and the benefits agile adoption will
have on such enterprises, companies and agencies.
1.2 Project Objectives
i. A review of Traditional Legacy Architecture and cost of IT maintenance,
upgrade and modernisation
ii. A review of Market adoption of Event-driven Architectures: A Case Study
of Netflix
iii. Analysis of Agile Frameworks in the Transformation from Traditional
Legacy Architecture to Event-driven Architecture
iv. Benefits of Agile Adoption in IT Modernisation when implementing Event
driven Architecture to replace Monolithic Systems
v. Operationalisation of Event-driven architecture using Bi-Modal Strategy in
decommissioning systems with Traditional Legacy Architecture
1.3 Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study is to determine the scope and impact of migrating from traditional
monolith architecture to microservices event-driven architecture by analysing the challenges
of maintaining a monolith system, migrating to EDA while avoiding disruption, and the
application of agile frameworks in the process. The study aims to meet the project objectives
by answering the following research questions, labelled RQ 1-2.
RQ 1: How to migrate to microservices event-driven architecture while not disrupting ongoing business operations that depend on the traditional architecture system?


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
3
Intending to migrate while ensuring minimal or no disruption to current system is a challenge and this research question aims to clarify that using the bimodal-operation strategy via relevant literature and industrial application guide.
RQ 2: What are the scope and impact of migrating to microservices event-driven architecture, including using agile frameworks?
This research question will analyse and compare the cost of maintenance of both architectures and their performance characteristics. This will help organisations who are reluctant to migrate their systems from monolith to microservices to make informed choices.
1.4 Intended Users
i. The academic community: At the end of this project, we expect to have more in-depth
knowledge of various event-driven architectures currently available and determine the
preferred architecture for enterprise systems.
ii. Software developers aiming to use the event-driven architecture in their practices:
Encourage painless use of agility as collaborating teams will be dealing with separate
modules that are highly independent and loosely coupled.
iii. Salescache: the report may help the company know how to maintain their system going
forward, as well as make the best choice of architecture in their future developments.
iv. Career progression

Chapter 2
Literature Review
In this chapter researcher conducts a review of literature by focusing on the research objectives
and research topic, that is “reviewing the scope and impact of implementing a modernised IT
event-driven architecture from traditional architecture using agile frameworks – a case study
of bi-modal operational strategy”.
2.1 A Review of Event-Driven Architecture
2.1.1 Event Driven Architecture Style
In 2006, Gartner closed an analytic group that focused on Event-driven architecture (EDA)
(Nkomo and Coetzee, 2019). The term EDA was proposed by Gartner Roy W. Schulte, an
analyst three years earlier in the Growing Role of Events in Enterprise Applications. Maybe
the concept was too revolutionary, or maybe the idea of Complex Event processing (CEP)
diverted the main attention, but because of the delay in introducing technologies such as RFID,
it went into the shadows, taking with it EDA, it doesn’t matter. For us, something else is
important: firstly, unlike Service-oriented architecture (SOA), EDA is really an architecture
(Talbot et al., 2019), i.e. a specific approach to building an enterprise information system;
secondly, the concept of event-driven architecture explains why today interest in the enterprise
service bus (ESB) is ahead of interest in SOA.
To begin with, why SOA is not an architecture. SOA was architecture at the time of its
appearance, while it was associated with such a picture (Yan et al., 2019). But the idea of pre
registering services in the registry and detecting them during execution did not work and the
real service-oriented architecture looks more like this. But EDA is really architecture, i.e. a
pattern that describes the interaction between software components, each of which has a


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
5
specific role: one component generates a message, the other intercepts and processes it, if
necessary, invokes third components for this. Generally speaking, this is what integration
environments have always dealt with.
The next subtlety is that to build a service-oriented architecture, the Enterprise service bus,
generally speaking, is not needed. Applications themselves can provide services (Talbot et al.,
2019). Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) was positioned as a tool for developing services for legacy
applications. But if such an application develops at least somehow, then you can remove the
program interfaces from it and wrap them with services without the help of the ESB. And if
the application is already completely inherited and no one understands how it functions there
within itself, then it will not be possible to “pull out” services from it using the ESB. But to
build an event-driven architecture, an integration environment is needed. Events must be
intercepted, converted, routed, etc. Thus, EDA puts everything in its place (Simchev, 2018).
The event-driven architecture includes event providers that create event flows, and event
consumers that listen for these events.
Figure 2.1: Event Driven Architecture Style (Dehbi, 2016)
Events are delivered almost instantly, which allows consumers to immediately respond to
events. Suppliers are not affiliated with consumers - no supplier knows who is listening to his
events. Consumers are also independent of each other, and each of them receives all the events
(Tang et al., 2015). This is an important difference from the competing customer template , in


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
6
which users retrieve messages from the queue and each message is processed only once (if no
errors occur). In some systems, such as the Internet of things, events are processed in huge
volumes.
In the above logical diagram, each type of consumer is indicated by a separate block. In
practice, multiple instances of each supplier are usually used so that they do not become a
single point of failure. Multiple instances may also be required to process events in the right
volumes and / or at the right speed. In addition, each receiver can handle events in multiple
threads. This can create problems if events need to be handled in order or require exactly one
semantics.
2.2 A Review of Microservices Architecture
The term “Microservice Architecture” has been used in the past few years as a description of
how to design applications as a set of independently deployed services (Kang, Le and Tao,
2016). While there is no exact description of this architectural style, there is a certain general
set of characteristics: organisation of services around business needs, automatic deployment,
transfer of logic from the message bus to receivers (endpoints) and decentralised control over
languages and data.
According to (Theorin et al., 2015), monolithic server is a fairly obvious way to build such
systems. All the logic for processing requests is performed in a single process, while you can
use the capabilities of your programming language to divide the application into classes,
functions, and namespace. One can run and test the application on the developer’s machine and
use the standard deployment process to check for changes before putting them into
production. One can scale a monolithic application horizontally by “running multiple physical
servers behind a load” balancer. Its roots go far into the past, at least to the design principles


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
7
used in Unix. But we nevertheless believe that not enough people take this style into account
and that many applications will benefit if they start using this style.
2.2.1 Microservice Architecture Properties
As mentioned by (Francesco, 2017), “there is a formal definition of the style of microservices,
but we can try to describe what we consider to be common characteristics” of applications
using this style. They are not always found in one application all at once, but, as a rule, each
such application includes most of these characteristics.
Remote calls are slower than calls within the process, and therefore the Application Programming
Interface (API) should be less detailed (coarse-grained), which often leads to inconvenience in
use. In a first approximation, we can observe that services are related to processes as one to
one. In fact, a service can contain “many processes that will always be developed and deployed
together”. For example, the application process and the database process that only this
application uses.
The microservice community prefers an alternative approach: smart message receivers and
transmission channels (Yarygina and Bagge, 2018). Applications built using the microservice
architecture tend to be as decoupled and cohesive as possible: they contain their own domain
logic and act more as filters in the classic Unix sense- they receive requests, apply logic and
send an answer. Instead of complex protocols such as Web Services Business Process Execution
Language (WS-BPEL), they use simple Representational State Transfer (REST) protocols. The
two most commonly used protocols are Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests through the
resource API and lightweight messaging.
Teams that practice “microservice architecture use the same principles and protocols that the
World Wide Web” is built on (and essentially Unix). Frequently used resources can be cached
with very little effort from developers or IT administrators. A second commonly used


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
8
communication tool is a lightweight message bus. Such an infrastructure usually does not
contain domain logic - simple implementations like RabbitMQ do nothing but provide an
asynchronous factory. In this case, logic exists at the ends of this bus - in services that send and
receive messages (Gannon, Barga and Sundaresan, 2017).
In a monolithic application, components work in one process and communicate with each other
through method calls. The biggest problem in “changing the monolith to microservices lies in
changing the communication template” (Strljic et al., 2019). One-to-one naive porting “leads
to coupled communications” that don’t work too well. There is the need to reduce the number
of communications between modules.
Breaking a monolith into microservices event-driven architecture, we have a choice of how to
build each of them (Mayer and Weinreich, 2018). Microservice teams also prefer a different
standardisation approach, thus, instead of using a set of predefined standards written by
someone, “they prefer the idea of building useful tools that other developers can use to solve
similar problems” (Mayer and Weinreich, 2018). These tools are usually extracted from the
code of one of the projects and shared between different teams, sometimes using the internal
open source model. Now that “git and GitHub have become the de facto standard version
control system, open source practices are becoming more and more popular in company
internal projects” (Mayer and Weinreich, 2018).
Netflix is a good example of an organisation that follows this philosophy (Gannon, Barga and
Sundaresan, 2017). Sharing useful and, moreover, library-tested code on battle servers
encourages other developers to solve similar problems in a similar way, leaving the possibility
of choosing a different approach if necessary. Shared libraries tend to focus on common issues
related to data storage, inter process communication, and infrastructure automation.

2.2.3 Microservices and EDA
The “microservice style is very similar to what some proponents of EDA” are promoting
(Strljic et al., 2019). The problem, however, is that the term EDA has too many different
meanings and, as a rule, what people call “EDA” differs significantly from the style described
here, usually due to the excessive focus on the ESB used for integrating monolithic
applications. In particular, we have seen so many unsuccessful EDA implementations (starting
with the tendency to hide complexity behind ESBs, ending with failed initiatives lasting several
years that cost millions of monies and did not bring any benefit), that it is sometimes too
difficult to ignore these problems.
These EDA issues have led some microservice proponents to abandon the term “EDA,” while
others consider microservices to be a form of EDA, or perhaps the correct implementation of
EDA (Strljic et al., 2019). In any case, the fact that EDA has different meanings means that it
is useful to have a separate term for this architectural style. Of course, many of the practices
used in microservices come from the experience of integrating services in large
organisations. The Tolerant Reader template is one example. Another example is the use of
simple protocols introduced as a reaction to centralised standards, the complexity of which
is breath-taking (Hasselbring and Steinacker, 2017).
2.3 A Review of Event-Driven Architecture Using Microservices As Platform
2.3.1 Event-Driven Microservices Patterns
As mentioned earlier, the microservice architecture style is a method of building an
application in the form of a discrete but independent management configuration based on
explicit knowledge of the business (Perez et al., 2018). Microservice-based applications can
be event driven. There are interesting engineering projects in rapid development and further
development. As stated by (Monteiro et al., 2018), the microservice approach offers


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
10
developers greater flexibility in choosing the perfect layout for information middleware.
Each use case has its own specific requirements, which require various information
innovations, such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ or even NoSQL event information matrices,
such as Apache Geode / Pivotal GemFire.
In the Micro Signal Architecture (MSA) approach, a typical architectural project captures
events using a nursery-only sequence of events, for example, Kafka or MapR feeds that
Kafka updates. Using MapR Streams, events are grouped into coherent sets of events called
subjects (Perez et al., 2018). Events are transmitted in the received request. Unlike the line,
events are permanent, and after transmission they remain significant in a packet that can be
accessed by different clients.
Figure 2.2: Kafka Based Architecture (Perez et al., 2018)
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a popular, non-competitive distribution architecture
project that solves the problems of dispersed information. It is exceptionally customisable
and adaptable. In EDA, every microservice sends an event when something unusual happens
(Khaddaj and Srour, 2016). For example, the request service dispatches a new event if a
request has been made or modified. Various microservices buy events that interest them (for
example, the inventory service will buy new request events, as this will reduce the inclusion


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
11
of irrelevant products in the inventory database). The event can be called a “big change of
state”. Events can be used to conduct trading that covers various jurisdictions (Mayer and
Weinreich, 2018). We can talk about exchanges with a sequence of steps, where each
sequence is a micro-service that updates or creates a commercial substance and distributes
an event that triggers the next phase. EDA has two main regions: intermediary and agent.
Event-driven microservices and architecture are the preferred methods for updating today’s
universal cloud applications. This architecture is ideal for creating a scene for the collection
and preparation of large flows of information. Switching between topologies: useful for
events in many ways (Khaddaj and Srour, 2016). It consists of four main segments: event
lines, mediator, event channels, and event handlers. Agent topology: in this geography there
is no central event between one event and another. There are two types of segments:
representative processors and events.
2.4 A review of Traditional Legacy (monolith) Architecture and cost maintenance, and
modernisation
Traditional or Legacy, often referred to as Monolith architecture are characterised by lack of
support, are obsolete for current needs of a business or organisation, and difficult to maintain,
improve, or integrate with new systems due to its architecture, underlying technology, or
design. In a survey conducted among CIOs by Logicalis Global CIO, 43 percent views complex
legacy technology a major barrier to digital transformation (Logicalis, 2017) and the answer is
modernisation. Monolith architecture modernisation is the redesign and upgrade of old
software system, and this normally results in maintenance costs becoming more and more
expensive.
There has not been a formal definition for monolith architecture, but it is being compared with
modular application architectureIt was recently that a better definition was given by (Dragoni
et al., 2017) as “software application whose modules cannot be executed independently”, rather


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
12
the components are maintained and bundled together, distributed and deployed as a whole. The
monolith as an architecture has some notable advantages, as it is easier to understand a specific
process as all the elements are in the same codebase. On the other hand, the approach has some
issues as well, for instance: any modification to any module of the application will require
alterations in other modules as the modules are inter-linked (Dragoni et al., 2017). Creating
more instances to Increasing the capacity of a software application to handle more requests in
a monolith is difficult, as the entire system must be replicated instead of the individual module
and more resource is wasted in the process (Ren et al., 2018). The size of monolith application
grows year by year and as its complexity increases, its maintainability decreases, especially if
good software design practices are not followed.
Currently, the cloud computing and hardware virtualisation are gaining relevance and provides
an opportunity for competitive advantage, and it is becoming essential for companies to ensure
flexibility on their systems. The need for organisational agility too is necessitating the need for
“capacity to flexibly respond to changes in the environment by quickly adjusting products and
service offerings” (Baskarada et al., 2018). Event-driven microservices architecture has been
considered as a viable solution (Baskarada et al., 2018) as it combines scalability,
maintainability, easy of deployment, less infrastructure cost, resilience, and reusability
(Carrasco et al., 2018). In spite of its short comings, some authors are of the opinion that
software development should start with a monolith, and then with time migrate it to event
driven microservices (Fowler, 2015). This pattern is called “monolith first”. However,
migrating a monolith can be a challenging process (Mishra et al, 2018). Monolith applications
still drive most of the largest business sites worldwide, they have also become a bottleneck for
innovation (Blockhuys, 2020).

2.5 Benefits of Agile Adoption for Large Enterprises
The rapidly evolving digital markets of today, as well as the increasingly intense struggle by
organisations to attract customers, mean that they must evolve with speed and unprecedented
agility (Gannon, Barga and Sundaresan, 2017). To cope with this reality, companies are
looking for an advantage that will allow them to distinguish themselves from their
competitors; and for many of them, this advantage consists in adopting agile methods.
Specialised studies, including Version One’s State of Agile Survey , report fairly
successful agile transformation experiences in companies. For less successful experiences, two
main factors can be identified: the difficulty in changing the corporate culture and the difficulty
in transforming middle management (Richter et al., 2017). Transforming culture is indeed not
easy and can induce a strong resistance to change that must be managed with tact. As for
management, it can quickly brace itself on old practices if the approach lacks listening and
pedagogy.
The agile methods are piloting practice groups and project realisation. They originate from
the Agile manifesto , written in 2001, which consecrates the term “agile” to reference multiple
existing methods (Gannon, Barga and Sundaresan, 2017). Agile methods are more “pragmatic
than traditional methods, involve the requester (client) as much as possible and allow great
responsiveness to their requests. They are based on an iterative, incremental and adaptive
development cycle and must respect four fundamental values broken down into twelve
principles from which derive a base of practices, either common” or complementary.
Thus, to simplify, these methods consist in studying and quickly evaluating whether or not a
solution is suitable for the organisation, in designing the solution, then in checking whether it
is doomed to failure or, hopefully, to success, all this in the fastest and most economical way
possible (Richter et al., 2017). Implementing this method for the design of microservices and
their adoption on a company scale considerably reduces the risk as well as the time and


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
14
resources invested, though the gains in terms of experience and learning are a factor of essential
optimisation.
The culture and values conveyed by agility can conflict with those currently present in the
company. It is believed that certain agile practices and values can prove to be in opposition to
the culture of the company and have, by their nature, more difficulty in establishing themselves
there than others (Kravari and Bassiliades, 2019). Agility is based on collaboration, a strong
value that induces research into synergies, trust and teamwork. This can for example be found
in contradiction with individual excellence, which induces a certain individual performance
and the development of own expertise.
A company can decide to deploy agile practices on a large scale. If the managerial model is
based on values of individual excellence, efficiency and a good dose of pragmatism, then
certain agile practices will have some of the difficulties to be implemented. Indeed, agile
managerial practices are based on autonomy, confidence and the development of team
motivation (Li et al., 2018). Thus, the agile practices that convey these cultural values may
prove to be out of step with the dominant culture of excellence of certain companies. During
particularly tense moments inherent in the lifecycle of a project, managers have a key role in
transforming an organisation towards agility. It is they who, by choosing to support and engage
or not in this transformation, determine the outcome (Kravari and Bassiliades, 2019). As Jon
Stahl explains in “Agile from top to bottom: leaders and leadership living agility”, leaders must
“embody the change they want to see born and set an example by reflecting agile values, by
managing by example, by seeking to really understand the culture and finally, being as
transparent as the teams they lead. This implies a posture of humility, empathy and confidence
in the ability of the organisation to transform itself (Mayer and Weinreich, 2018).
The change must not come only from management, the teams are the best drivers of this
change. Within a para-public organisation, they supported the deployment of a large number


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
15
of agile practices and values. The transformation project was a success, but the biggest
difficulty was the structuring of autonomous teams, insofar as the corporate culture was
structurally based on a strong sense of hierarchy and control (Li et al., 2018). Managers had
difficulty taking on the role of facilitator and letting go. It is a fairly frequent resistance to
change that can have significant impacts on teams in terms of motivation and taking
responsibility. And adopting agile practices in maintaining or creating a monolith architectural
system has similar challenge.
Any agile methodology provides for the splitting of software development steps (Leppänen, Savaglio
and Fortino, 2020), unlike the traditional method which foresees the total planning of the project even
before its development, the Agile Manifesto advocates rather the setting of short-term objectives.
Agile methods make it a point of honour to strengthen relationships between members of the project
team, but also between the team and the client. It is for this reason that flexibility and flexibility in
organisation are two fundamental pillars of agile methods.
2.6 Benefits of Implementation of Event-Driven Architecture for Large Enterprises
The growing complexity of enterprise applications often leads to poor architecture, and the
organisation spends more and more money on creating IT systems (Krämer, Frese and Kuijper,
2019). Event-driven architecture is designed to partially solve this problem by reducing the
connectivity of software components or services. The purpose of event-driven architecture is
to build systems in which components are loosely coupled.
The key concept in event-oriented architecture is the event. An event is a significant change in
state. Events are passed between loosely coupled services and represent stages in some kind of
business process. The service subscribes, observes events and responds to them. The Observer
pattern helps to understand the concept of event-driven architecture (Al-Masri, 2018). In the
Observer template, an object called a subject contains a list of objects called observers and


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
16
notifies them of any change in state. Using events and observers allows you to make services
loosely coupled.
Event-driven architecture helps create high-performance and highly accessible systems
(Krämer, Frese and Kuijper, 2019). Designing systems asynchronous from start to finish allows
you to minimise the time of thread blocking on IO operations and use the network bandwidth
at full capacity. All observers can respond to event alerts in parallel, forcing multi-core
processors and clusters to operate at the highest power. When a distributed system is running
in a cluster, events can be delivered to any node in the cluster, providing transparent load
balancing and failover (Alwis et al., 2019).
The past few years have seen an increase in the popularity of microservice architecture (Al
Masri, 2018). There are many arguments against the use of microservices, but the most
significant of them is that this type of architecture is fraught with uncertain complexity, the
level of which depends on how you manage the relationship between your services and teams.
Microservices assume the modularity of the code and the entire infrastructure (databases, etc.).
In a correctly implemented microservice architecture, each service has its own
infrastructure. Access to the user database (read and write) can be carried out only by the Users
service (Boyer et al., 2018).
Microservices help solve organisational problems and give us the ability to manage the code
base, which is changed by several teams (Mena et al., 2019). The separation of the code base
prevents conflicts when making changes.
2.7 Recommendations for Best Practices and Adoption Coupling Compliance and Business
Agility
Large organisations as a whole will develop more slowly than their more flexible and advanced
competitors and are increasingly immune to change (Boyer et al., 2018). The advanced and


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
17
flexible structure of the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) finally becomes an integral asset that
large associations can use to tackle problems that negatively affect corporate performance.
SAFe offers large associations a system with which they can be more flexible so that their
expectations are more accessible (Mena et al., 2019). Learn about the favourable circumstances
and standards and how to best implement this system and its approaches.
SAFe contains many standards, procedures, and best practices that large associations can use
to implement flexible strategies like Lean and Scrum to quickly create and transfer world-class
resources and administrations (Strljic et al., 2019). SAFe is particularly well suited for complex
tasks involving numerous large groups at the company, program and portfolio levels. The
current module, SAFe 4.6, is based on a number of key functions that enable companies to
effectively monitor and successfully adapt to disruptions in innovation to report instability,
changes in customer needs and increasing success.
Agile and nimble leadership: Pioneers must stimulate and support significant change and work
efficiency. Ultimately, it is the supervisory team that can influence individuals and groups to
understand their hidden abilities (Strljic et al., 2019).
2.8 Bi-modal Operational Strategy
The concept of a bimodal IT department has evolved ambiguously since the analytic company
Gartner first introduced this model in 2014 (Xu et al., 2017). Some experts believe that this
model, which implies parallel work on both everyday tasks and innovations, is just a practical
recommendation for IT directors.


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
18
2.8.1 Business Case for a Bimodal IT Model
Using the bimodal IT model, if used correctly, can effectively convey to the rest of the business
the real value of the IT solutions and help them get the most out of the technologies that are
already available and used by the company (Christoforou, Odysseos and Andreou, 2019). If
CIOs can continue to provide the main work of the department and at the same time create a
business case for innovations, their ideas can find support from above (Christoforou, Odysseos
and Andreou, 2019).
Direct business executives themselves are already able to use clouds and platforms like
Amazon Web Services to launch new services on demand. Enterprises of traditional
specialisation, such as banks and insurance companies, establish units in their activities that
are dedicated to digital business forms. These organisations have realised that they must
compete effectively (Reilly, 2020).
Such distinguished structures are a good example of a bimodal IT model: the firm continues to
engage in core business, but at the same time tries to develop something new (Leppänen,
Savaglio and Fortino, 2020). However, it is imperative that CIOs do not see the bimodal IT
model as a lifesaver. In the best case, this model should be used as a transitional stage, while
the leadership in the meantime should prepare for the continuous implementation of change
(Avritzer et al., 2020).
There is some element of danger in the bimodal IT model. CIOs of traditional architecture
views who are not keeping pace with the requirements of globalisation can come to a meeting
of the board of directors, talk for a long time about the need to support basic IT operations and
thus justify the absence of changes (Ren et al., 2017). IT infrastructure existed as part of the
enterprise only because we could not instruct anyone on the side to deal with it. Now we have
the clouds, and this has become possible.


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
19
The business is undergoing fundamental changes (Leppänen, Savaglio and Fortino, 2020). In the
financial sector, a competitor-novice can come up with a completely new type of product, and
in the traditional architecture business model, it can take a whole year to respond
adequately. So, organisations have to get used to the changes, take them for granted and work
with them in mind (Oparin, Bogdanova and Pashinin, 2019).
Thus, a bimodal approach to information technology can help IT leaders convince others of the
powerful potential for innovation. However, according to Hudson as stated earlier, CIOs
should not really rely on a bimodal IT concept (Ren et al., 2017). The managers of business
units have already been overloaded with overly promoted technical terms, and the vague
wording can hardly improve the negative impression of everything related to information
technology.
It is necessary to bring the project to the market carefully, taking into account all the
nuances. They need to interest people and give them the opportunity to take a fresh look at
information technology (Oparin, Bogdanova and Pashinin, 2019). The task of CIOs is to help
all business participants realise that change through technology is great, like migrating from a
monolith to microservices event-driven architecture. A bimodal model can give IT projects a
more positive image.
The key step to success is to achieve positive results using a bimodal IT model. In the end,
businessmen need exactly the results. Using a bimodal approach, you can lower the barrier to
maximise the benefits of IT solutions and, by experimenting, achieve the positive results that
business needs so much (Jackson and Lui, 2017). A bimodal IT model simply acts as a tool. With
a competent approach to business, and they need to figure out what this tool is and how it can
be used to improve the business.

2.9 A Review of Market adoption of Event-driven Architectures
As a result of the obvious challenges with monolith architecture, and the critical need to
maintain competitive advantage, companies are migrating to microservices event-driven
architecture. Notable of them are LinkedIn, Amazon, Netflix, IBM, Uber, SoundCloud and
others (Ren et al., 2018), and a brief review will be done on Netflix. A microservice architecture
consists of autonomous components that can be deployed in separation. “Microservice event
driven architecture is a distributed application where all its modules are microservices”
(Dragoni et al., 2017). It consists of a distributed application in which its behaviour depends
on the communication, composition, and coordination of its components via messages (Dragini
et al., 2017).
Microservices is one of the latest movements in software architecture, particularly the event
driven frameworks for creating loosely coupled components. It is an evolution of the oldest
concept of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) which relies on middleware like Enterprise
Service Bus (ESB), and Web Service Description Language (WSDL), microservices on the
other hand rely only on simple technologies like Representational State Transfer (REST).
Furthermore, SOA is normally viewed as an integration solution of already existing systems,
while microservices are typically used to develop new and individual software systems
(Jamshidi et al., 2018).


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
21
Figure 2.3: An event-driven architecture for an e-commerce site (AWS, 2020)
2.10 Case Study of Netflix
Netflix is one of the big enterprises that has migrated to microservices from the traditional
monolith application in 2009. Today, Netflix has more than 800 microservices running, and
serving around 2 billion requests daily, with about 20 billion internal API hits in these
microservices.
When Netflix started moving from a monolith to microservices architecture, the term
“microservices” did not exist. They used to have a big monolith application and the movement
to microservices started when the application experienced a major database bottleneck that shut
off operations for three days in which they were unable to ship DVDs to their clients. This was
because the databases in monolith systems have single point of failure. The situation inspired
them to consider migrating from ‘vertically scaled single point of failure’ (Meshenberg, 2016),
referring to the relational databases in their datacentre containing monolith systems, towards
highly reliable, horizontally scalable, distributed systems in the cloud. They picked Amazon


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
22
Web Services (AWS) as their cloud provider. AWS provided them with the greatest scale and
the broadest set of services and features.
They started with moving the movie encoding code base, a non-customer-oriented application,
to small new microservices. This is the best method to ensure minimal or no disruption to the
online services. (Sharma, 2017) suggests to always move non-customer-oriented components
from monolith to microservices architecture first. This is because, when such components fail,
there will be less impact on traffic and the customer experience on the production. After
successfully moving non-customer-oriented components, they started moving customer
oriented components. Netflix completed migrating their application to the microservices
architecture in 2016 and shut off their remaining data centres.
Figure 2.4: Netflix monolith architecture
The diagram above depicts a monolith architecture, similar with Netflix’s system back in 2008
that crashed and shut off business for four days. The system has a single point of failure and
once there is a problem, the whole system crashes.
2.11 Issues Observed and Recommendations for Best Practices
Some development teams find advantages over monolithic in microservice architecture (Reilly,
2020). Others consider microservices an unnecessary load that reduces performance. Like
every architectural style, microservices have both advantages and disadvantages. This study


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
23
presents the specific cases where it is better to use a microservice architecture so that the choice
is reasonable (Chen, Li and Li, 2018).
The first advantage of microservices is the loosely coupling of the modules. This is an
important, but rather strange advantage, since in theory it is not clear why microservices should
have more flexible module boundaries than monolithic code (Fowler, 2015). A good modular
structure is useful for each program, but only with the growth of the development team and the
increase in the size of the software does it become vital. Proponents of microservices
immediately recall Conway Law, according to which the system reflects the communication
structure of the organisation into which it was developed.
With the growth of teams (especially if they are geographically distributed), it is important to
structure the software so that communications between individual groups are less frequent and
more formal than within groups. And microservices allow you to comply with this pattern of
communications, providing each team with relatively independent elements of the system.
As stated above, there is no reason to believe that a monolithic system cannot have a good
modular structure (Guiotto et al., 2015). But we know that this happens extremely rarely, and
the most common architectural concept for monolithic systems is the “Big Ball of Mud”, which
is increasingly becoming the reason for turning towards microservices.
Separation in this case works because the boundaries of the module provide a barrier to inter
module links (Masala et al., 2017). In a monolithic system, as a rule, such a barrier is easy to
circumvent. This allows you to quickly add new features, but with widespread use, this
approach undermines the modular structure and reduces team productivity. Separating modules
into separate services makes the boundaries more stringent and getting around them becomes
more difficult.
In addition, early adopters of new ideas are usually more talented, which gives an additional
delay for evaluating the modular benefits of microservice systems written by medium-sized


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
24
development teams. Everything that can be said now is based on the testimonies of
development teams who have used this style. They say that supporting modules with
microservices is much easier for them.
At that time, “microservice architecture became useful, since the system was able to cope with
the rapid influx of developers, and the development team” was able to use a large number of
teams much easier than with a monolithic approach (Rezaei et al., 2017). As a result, the project
accelerated to a greater extent than would have been expected with a monolithic approach,
which allowed the team to catch up with the schedule. The overall result, however, was
negative at that time, because software took more man-hours than it would be on a monolithic
architecture.
Microservices are prone to inconsistency due to their respectable “insistence on decentralised
data management”. In a monolithic system, you can update many objects in one
transaction. With microservices, it will take several resources to upgrade and distributed
transactions. As a result, now developers must remember the possibility of inconsistency and
think about how to determine the moments of desynchronization before embarking on
programming task.
The monolithic world is not free from these problems. As the system grows, the need to use
caching to improve performance grows, and invalidating the cache is another difficult task
(Pitakrat et al.,2018). Most applications require offline locks to avoid long-running database
transactions. External systems require updates that cannot be negotiated using the transaction
manager, and business processes are often more tolerant of inconsistencies than could be
assumed, because companies usually prefer the availability of consistency.
The use of microservices, amongst other things, was caused by the complexity of deploying
large monolithic systems, where a small change in part of the system can lead to failure of the
entire deployment (Ge et al., 2017). There are also many examples of unsuccessful attempts to


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
25
use microservice architectures in independent deployments, when releases of several services
need to be carefully coordinated.
In the literature review, there was no conclusive or satisfactory answer found for the
performance differences and the cost of maintenance of the two architectures that could help
us determine the scope and impact of migrating to microservices event-driven architecture.
Therefore, this study aims to study this which is the focus of this research work.

Chapter 3
Methodology
This research work is conducted by reviewing existing literature from peer reviewed articles,
journals, documents published by major middleware companies, and books authored by
software professionals and researchers on the relevant subject matter. The answers to research
questions (RQ1and RQ2) are sought using empirical study of relevant literature from previous
studies and from publications by companies, including developing prototypes of the two
architectures to be used for an experiment to obtain their performance metrics, as well as
obtaining and analysing cost of maintenance to enable the comparison of what an organisation
likely spends maintaining a monolith or a microservice application per month (Kramer, Frese
and Kuijper, 2019).
For the methodology, this work chose to use an experiment to obtain numerical data of the
performance metrics, which could not be obtained from surveys, case studies and interviews.
To conduct the experiment, a monolith and microservice application prototypes were
developed and integrated with Dropwizard metrics, an open source library for measuring the
performance of web applications and paired with SpringBoot actuator to enable measurement.
An Apache JMeter was also installed and used to simulate number of users sending requests to
the applications simultaneously, and the response time taken. Performance aspects such as
RAM usage, CPU usage, Response Time, Scalability and Latency were considered. The
prototypes developed were basic in nature and hosted locally and the sole purpose of creating
the prototypes is to enable simulation and collect required data for the analysis. The monolith
application was hosted on localhost:8080, while the microservice application consisting of a
gateway frontend and two microservices were hosted on a Docker container.

3.1 Experiment Design
This begins with the Experiment definition, explaining the purpose of conducting the
experiment, sketch description of the architectures and setting. The Independent and Dependent
variables are then presented, followed by experiment steps and what tools were used to gather
the performance data.
3.1.1 Experiment Definition
In the literature review, (Chen, Li and Li, 2018) discussed about situations where it is better to
migrate to microservices and other cases where it is best to use monolith architecture. (Pitakrat
et al., 2018) also pointed out an issue regarding the behaviour of monolith systems, observing
that as the monolith grows over time and the number of request calls increases, its performance
to drops and the system becomes increasingly slower. This study aims to analyse this using
system metrics and conducting an experiment seemed to be the best way to obtain actual
performance differences.
3.1.2 Research Setting
The research setting simulates two applications: a monolith and a microservice, that have user
interface, REST API, business logic and database, and integrated with a Dropwizard Metrics
paired with SpringBoot actuator, an open source library for measuring the performance of web
applications. The applications were developed using angular client-side code for frontend, java
application to integrate with the backend.
3.1.2.1 The Monolith Application
Figure 3.1: Monolith architecture running on localhost


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
28
The monolith application was built using angular, html and CSS for user interface, Java
application to integrate with the backend MySQL database, integrated with DropWizard Mtrics
and SpringBoot Actuator to enable measurement of system metrics. The frontend has
ecommerce entities comprising products, product category, customer, product order, order
item, invoice and shipment. However, it is important to note that the invoice in monoliths has
performance issue when the number of user request calls is high, thus slowing down the system.
3.1.2.2 The Microservice Application
Figure 3.2: Microservice architecture running on Docker machine
Unlike the monolith application, the microservice application has application Gateway which
is the frontend developed using angular, html and CSS with MySQL database to store user
roles and just like the monolith, it has entities of products, product category, customer, product
order, order item and shipment. However, to address the performance issue identified in the
monolith application with the invoice entity, it has been isolated into a stand-alone
microservice and integrated with a MySQL database, in addition to creating a notifications
microservice and integrated with a mongo database. The registry is a separate application in
the Docker machine that links the application Gateway and the independent microservices. A
DropDown Wizard metrics and SpringBoot Actuator was integrated to enable reading of
performance of the application.


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
29
3.1.3 Independent Variables
The independent variables for the experiment is the number of user requests simulated using
JMeter while the applications were running.
3.1.4 Dependent Variables
The dependent variables for the experiment are the average response time and line response
time measured in milliseconds.
3.1.5 Experimental Steps
The experiment steps consisted of development of monolith and microservices applications,
then measuring test cases and collecting performance data.
3.1.6 Measurement Instrument
To measure the user response time, the latest versions of JMeter and dropwizard metrics were
used.
3.1.7 Measurement Objects
The measurements were conducted in a test plan for JMeter and Dropdown wizard metrics. For
the JMeter, a ramp up period of 60seconds were used to run each test case for two minutes,
followed with a delay of two minutes before starting the next. The JMeter represented users
making a REST request to the user interface in an ecommerce store. This request could be
searching a product, placing an order, and transacting an invoice. JMeter is used to distribute
load across systems and analyse performance, such as response time and error rate.
Two test cases s1 and s2 were performed for the two architectures:
S1 – 10 simultaneous user requests per minute
S2 – 1,100 simultaneous user requests per minute
3.1.8 Data Collection
After starting and running the monolith application in localhost 8080, and the microservices in
Docker container respectively, the test plans were conducted and read, and captured snapshots
of performance metrics, which was then extracted into Excel for analysis.


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
30
3.1.9 Data Analysis
The data was extracted into Excel where it is analysed and summarised into tables and
diagrams.
The dropdown wizard metrics tool provided the system metrics such as RAM, CPU usage,
while the Apache JMeter provided performance aspects like average response time, 90%-line
response time, error rate and throughput. The purpose of analysing these performance metrics
is to help in understanding which architecture performs best when number of user request calls
increases. Only metrics that will help in answering the research questions are used.
The diagrams and tabulated results are used to help in finding the differences between the two
architectures. The result from the experiment is presented in Results and Analysis.
3.1.10 Validity Threats
The first validity threat is that the experiment used a small number of users for the sample test,
and this is because the experiment was conducted in a single computer rather than a distributed
system. However, with more users, a higher scalability difference could have been observed.
The reason of limiting the sample test case to 1,100 simultaneous user requests is that the
system could not handle more than that at a go. This limitation could be handled using a
distributed system.
Secondly, the applications were run locally on localhost and docker. The results might vary if
hosted on the cloud servers.

Results
RQ 2: What are the scope and impact of migrating to microservices event-driven architecture,
including using agile frameworks?
To answer this research question, experimental data comparing performance characteristics is
presented, as well as data supporting cost of maintenance and impact on agile teams obtained
from industry. Firstly, the experimental results will be presented first, then the data comparing
the cost of maintenance and agile teams will be presented next.
4.0 Experimental Results
4.1 Response Time
Response time was measured for the sample cases s1 and s2 on the monolith and microservice
systems. Response time is the elapsed time prior to sending the request, and immediately after
the response is received. To measure response time, test plans were created to run a constant
workload of 10 and 1100 requests per minute for a duration of 5 minutes on each architecture,
resulting in a total of 55 and 5500 requests respectively. This is within the tolerant level of the
systems without crashing. For response time, two samples s1 of 10 requests and s2 of 1100
requests were made for both architectures. When 10 user requests were made, the response
time for monolith architecture was 283.7 milliseconds, far lower compared to microservices
that took 322.9 milliseconds. Thus, when the number of user requests is lower, monolith
performs better than microservices. On the other hand, a request call of 1100 showed a
contrasting result. The response time for monolith was 285.33 compared to microservice which
returned 210.0, showing a decrease in 75.33 milliseconds. This proves why as monolith
systems grow over the years their performance decreases and becomes a bottleneck to maintain.


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks

Microservices on the other hand are robust and can handle increasing request calls. The table
and graph show the test results.
Sample Monolith (milliseconds) Microservice (milliseconds) S1 (10 requests) 283.7 322.9 S2 (1100 requests) 285.33 210.0

Figure 4.1: Response time graph
4.2 Line Response Time
90% Line response time is the range above which 90% of request calls are faster. Just like in
the response time discussed above, the monolith architecture performs best when the number
of request calls is fewer, and worse when the request calls increases. Microservices on the other
hand does not show optimum advantage with fewer request calls. However, its robustness and
scalability is noticed when number of request calls grows.
Sample Monolith 90% (ms) Microservice 90% (ms) S1 (10 requests) 308 403 S2 (1100 requests) 354.33 275.33 Table 4.2: Line Response time for monolith and microservices
Figure 4.2: Line response time graph

4.3 Error Rate
Error rate was measured for the sample cases, s1 and s2. Error rate depicts the number of failed
requests that returned a response with status code 500, implying an internal server error. Test
plans were created to run a constant workload of 2000 requests per minute for a duration of 5
minutes on the monolith and microservice, resulting in a total of 10000 requests. This was done
purposely to stress the systems to the point of crashing for the purpose of analysing how the
two different architectures handle errors. To measure error rate, the use case for monolith was
represented with s1 and use case for microservice s2. The test performed for the monolith, s1,
returned an error rate of 62%, while the microservice, s2, returned 17% error rate. This means
that of the 10000 requests sent, the monolith architecture has a 38% successful response with
a status code of 200, resulting in 3800 successful requests. The microservices on the other hand,
has 83% response with a status code of 200, that is about 8300 successful requests. The results
are presented in the table and graphically below.

4.4.3 Communication Support for Agile Frameworks
A unique advantage of microservices over monolith is the size of the development team. The
number of communication channels increases with the number of team members. The formula
for the number of communication channels is n(n-1)/2.
For example, a team with 20 developers will have 190 possible channels of communication.
Figure 4.4: Monolith vs. Microservices communication channels as number of developers grows
As the graph shows, from size of 10 developers, the microservice model shows a unique
advantage over the monolith.

Chapter 5
Analysis and Discussions
This research work discussed the challenges with monolith architecture and presented reasons
organisations are migrating to microservices. However, many other organisations are reluctant
to migrate to microservices, and that is where this research work comes in: to answer the
questions why migrating to microservice is beneficial to the modern technology. The study
objectives and research question one (RQ 1) were met in the literature review, while the
experiment, cost of maintenance and agile frameworks were met in research question two (RQ
2). In this chapter, an attempt will be made to analyse how the research questions were
addressed.
RQ 1: How to migrate to microservices event-driven architecture while not disrupting
ongoing business operations that depend on the traditional architecture system?
5.1 Migrating to Microservices with Minimal or No Disruption to Business Operations
Deducing answers from the literature review and from the prototypes developed for the
experiment, the first method to migrate from monolith to microservice is following what
(Strljic et al., 2019) observed and following the recommended solution. According to them, the
biggest problem in changing monolith to microservice lies in changing the communication
template. The recommended solution is to reduce the number of communications between
modules. This relates with the experiment carried out in this project in which the invoice
module from the monolith was separated and converted to a separate microservice, in addition
to creating a notification microservice. This reduced the number of communication channels.
Another method an organization can use to migrate to microservices with minimal or no
disruption to ongoing business functions is to adopt the bimodal IT strategy. The strategy


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
37
encourages parallel work on systems. This means continuing to maintain the monolith system
while building the proposed microservice at the same time (Leppänen, Savaglio and Fortino,
2020). This method is obviously expensive as it implies creating a new system from scratch.
The third method is following the Netflix case study. Netflix migrated their monolith to
microservices moving the movie encoding code base, a. non-customer-oriented application,
which ensured minimal or no disruption to the online services. (Sharma, 2017) recommends
moving the non-customer-oriented applications first, noting that even when such components
fail, there will be less impact on traffic and the customer experience on the system. After
successfully migrating the non-customer-oriented components, start migrating customer
oriented components.
The above three methods are the findings that attempted answering the research question 1 (RQ
1).
RQ 2: What are the scope and impact of migrating to microservices event-driven
architecture, including using agile frameworks?
To answer this research question, the experimental results, cost of maintenance and agile
communications will be analysed.
5.2 Response Time
At 10 request calls, the monolith system had a response time of 283.7 milliseconds compared
to microservices which took 322 milliseconds. Thus, the microservice had a slower response
time of 38.3 milliseconds. On the other hand, at 1100 request calls, the monolith system had a
response time of 285.33 milliseconds versus microservices response time of 210 milliseconds.
This time around, the microservice responded faster with about 75.33 milliseconds.
For Line Response Time, there was a related trend: the monolith system under 10 request calls
responded within 308 milliseconds, while microservices responded within 403 milliseconds.


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
38
That is, monolith responded faster, and microservices was slower with 95 milliseconds. As the
request calls was increased to 1100, however, monolith responded within 354.33 milliseconds,
while microservices responded within 275.33 milliseconds. That is, the microservice was faster
with about 79 milliseconds.
The trends show that when the number of users requesting calls to the system are few, such as
10 request calls, the monolith system will always outperform microservices. On the other hand,
as the users visit to the system increases, sending increased request calls, such as 1100 calls,
monolith system will show decreased response time, while the microservice will be able to
handle such requests faster.
This finding shows that if a proposed system, like a web application is not intended for large
users sending in requests at the same time, and there is no likelihood that the system would
grow in future, the it is recommended to use a monolith architecture. On the other hand, if the
proposed application is an e-commerce with projected large users visiting and placing requests
at the same time, for example Black Friday deals, then a microservice architecture system is
highly recommended. In summary, the bigger the system, the more advantageous
microservices architecture will have over the monolith architecture.
5.3 Error Rate
The results show a monolith system, s1, with an error rate of 62% compared to a microservices
system, s2, with error rate of 17% during the crash experiment. The microservice, s2, has a
significant higher fault tolerance than the monolith system, s1. This finding has supported the
theory that monolith systems have a single point of failure as all the modules are interlinked
and connected to a single database (Ge et al., 2017), hence a fault in a module may cause the
whole system to crash. Microservices on the other hand, are loosely coupled and each
microservice has own database and as a result, when there is an issue with a single microservice


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
39
or database, it rarely affects the whole system. The point of failure in a microservice can be
easily isolated and reconfigured.
5.4 Cost of Maintenance
As the cost of maintenance shows in table 4.4 and table 4.5, for money spent on resources,
microservices deliver more throughput and more precise scaling. For example, if a monolith is
using all the resources, to handle more connections means bringing in another instance. On the
other hand, if a single microservice uses all the resources, only this service will need more
instances. Microservices are less resource intensive, and this saves resources.
From the tables, the monthly cost of microservices architecture was $390.96 versus the $403.20
for the monolith architecture. The result shows that the microservice architecture has a reduced
cost of $12.24, and when using AWS Lambda, the costs can be reduced further. For example,
when a monolith is running on the biggest AWS instance, m5.24xlarge instance with 96 CPUs
and 384 GB RAM, the present cost is $2,119.19 per month for the instance running 24 hours 7
days (24/7). For the same money, 12 c5.2xlarge instances with 8 virtual CPUs and 16GB of
RAM each running 24 hours 7 days (27/7) can be bought to run microservices (Kainz, 2020).
Figure 5.1: Price of 12 on-demand microservice containers vs. a dedicated large monolith container (Kainz, 2020)
5.5 Benefits of Agile Methods
Agile methods and frameworks give organisations competitive advantage, improves
communication and collaboration among team members and makes it easier to adopt modern
practices in the industry (Gannan, Barga and Sundaresan, 2017). As the graph in figure 4.4


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
40
shows, communication channels are increasing as team size goes up in monoliths but increases
relatively slower in microservices. For instance, as the graph shows: in monoliths, a team of
20 developers have a communication channel of 190; a team of 40 developers have a
communication channel of 780, a team of 60developers have a communication channel of
1770, and so on. On the other hand, in microservices, a team of 20 developers have a
communication channel of 50; a team of 40 developers have a communication channel of 200,
and a team of 60 developers have a communication channel of 400 and so on which are quite
significantly lower in comparison to the teams in monoliths. Microservices with loosely
coupled and isolated microservices enables the breaking of big teams into many smaller teams,
thereby significantly reducing the communication channels. As a result, microservices can cope
with rapid influx of developers (Rezaei et al., 2017), and large development teams can
collaborate easily. Monoliths on the other hand are more expensive to maintain considering the
challenge in coordinating communication and collaboration among increasing teams.

Project Management
6.1 Project Schedule
The project schedule was defined during the project proposal as an approximate timeline to
be followed, but with options for alteration as possible, because the researcher did not have a
clear structure and definite direction for the project at outset. The table below shows the
original project timeline:
6.1.1 Project Timeline
Activity Duration
1 Project topic definition 26th May-18th June
2 Secondary data collection and processing 27th May-25th June
3 Primary Data cleaning, processing and storage 26th June-5th July
4 Discussion of findings 6th July-9th July
5 Working on CW2 9th July-16th July
6 Documentation 14th July-10th August
Table 6.1: Timeline
Following feedback from the research proposal, the project topic had to be narrowed further,
and this means that project objectives, research questions and methodology had to be altered
as well.
Further, the initial research methodology was to obtain big data on the project topic from
dataset sites. Unfortunately, the researcher could not find available dataset suitable for the
research. As such, project supervisor advised creating prototype applications and generate
required data. Therefore, the research methodology was changed from data collection and


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
42
processing to creating prototypes and performing experiments. This impacted the original
project plan and caused activities to be behind schedule.
6.1.2 Current Project Plan
Activity Duration
1 Final project topic 19th June, 2020
2 Literature search continues 27th May-30th June
3 Creating prototypes for monolith and microservice applications 9th July-15th July

6.2.3 The changes in project plan includes the following:
i. Change in project topic. The initial project topic was too broad and had to be
narrowed down.
ii. Change in the literature search in order to suit the new topic
iii. Change from data collection to experimentation as the means to obtain the required
primary data for analysis and discussion
6.3 Risk Management
The university of Oregon, uoregon (nd) has listed potential risks students undertaking
research are likely to face. These include:
i. Physical risks: This could manifest in physical discomfort, pain, injury, or illness that
may result from the methods and procedures of the research.
ii. Psychological risks: This may include the effects of anxiety, depression, guilt, shock
and loss of self-esteem. Others are sensory deprivation, sleeplessness, use of
hypnosis, deception or mental stress.
iii. Social or Economic risks: this may include alterations in relationships with others,
financial issues and loss of employment.
iv. Loss of Confidentiality: This is a risk associated with researches involving human
subjects where confidentiality of presumed information is expected to be maintained
judiciously. Great care needs to be taken to avoid inversion of privacy and personal
dignity.
v. Legal risks: This exists when the research methods are in a way that the subject will
be liable for a violation of the law.


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks

6.4 Risk Assessment
The researcher used Risk Assessment Tool available at myriskassessment.co.uk to define and
analyse possible risks, as well as possible precautions and actions to be taken if the risk
happens.
6.4.1 Physical Risk
Figure 6.3: Physical risk


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks

47
6.4.3 Legal Risk
Figure 6.5: Legal risk
So far, the researcher has not experienced any serious risks, except the unexpected changes to the project
schedule that threatened to slow down the progress, especially when the researcher had to create
prototypes for monolith and microservice applications in order to experiment with certain system
metrics and obtain required numerical data for analysis.
6.5 Social, Legal, Ethical and Professional Considerations
To comply with the above, the researcher was made to read, answer all relevant questions and
agree to abide by the extant rules guiding research work. Moreover, the research was certified
low risk ethics approval.
More, the researcher adheres to the ethical principles of Association of Computing
Machinery (ACM) code of ethics and professional conduct (ACM, 2020), especially the
following:


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
48
General Ethical Principles:
1.1 Be honest and trustworthy:
being transparent and providing full disclosure of all system capabilities, limitations, and
potential problems to the appropriate parties concerned.
1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate:
The researcher takes this principle into account when comparing monolith and microservice
architectures.
1.5 Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, &
computing artefacts:
The researcher kept this principle into account and cites relevant sources whose work is used,
using appropriate referencing system.
1.6 Respect privacy and confidentiality:
This research work did not use interviews, questionnaires and primary data that require
personal information.

Conclusion
This thesis set out to review the scope and impact of migrating from monolith architecture to
microservices event-driven architecture, how agile methodology plays a role, and the
application of bi-modal IT strategy. The study formulated research objectives which were the
focus throughout the literature review. Two research questions were set and to answer these,
web application prototypes were developed for monolith and microservices architectures and
deployed on localhost and docker respectively. Open source metric tools were integrated to
measure performance metrics such as response time, and error rate of the two architectures and
data was collected and analysed. More, industrial cost of maintenance of the two architectures
was also obtained and analysed.
Achievements
In addressing the first research question: how to migrate to microservices without disrupting
ongoing business operations on the system, three possible methods were found and detailed in
chapter 5.1, the analysis and discussions chapter. The experience from creating prototypes of
monolith and microservices applications showed that converting a monolith to microservice
involves converting some modules of the application to independent and separate
microservices with their own individual databases. This reduces the number of
communications channels and improves performance of the system and ensure better user
experience and this was in agreement with the findings of (Strljic et al., 2019). The second
method is the bi-modal IT strategy where an organization can maintain the monolith application
while building the microservices application at the same time. The third method is converting


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
50
the monolith application itself, but by migrating the non-customer-oriented functions first, as
these hardly affect the operation of the system if problem arises.
To answer research question 2: the scope and impact of migrating to microservices, findings
on response time show that if the application is not intended to grow in size and there are no
increasing user request calls, a monolith application is best as it outperforms microservices.
However, if the application is expected to grow in size and handle growing user requests, then
a microservices application is the best option. Analysing error rate also show that microservices
better fault tolerance than a monolith. Microservices also allows companies to reduce their
infrastructure costs and thus easier to maintain. Finally, microservices enable large applications
to be developed as a set of small applications that can be independently implemented and
operated by separate teams, thus promoting the application of agile frameworks in the
organisations.
Future Works
The prototypes developed for this experimental study were basic in nature and thus might have
affected the accuracy and reliability of the metric results to some extent. For future work,
applications with more parts, complex functions, features and calculations hosted on the cloud
might potentially produce far reliable results for both monoliths and microservices.
Also, most studies on monoliths and microservices are limited to web and desktop applications.
Extending this to investigate the performance differences on mobile applications is highly
encouraged.

Student Reflection
8.1 Personal Performance
This project work has been a challenge, considering that the topic of investigation has been
germane to me, without having prior knowledge and experience in monoliths and
microservices. Having recently started a part-time as a web developer with a task to develop
an e-commerce application from monoliths to microservices, it was a challenge to venture into
a new field, and the opportunity to conduct a research study to investigate migrating from
monoliths to microservices has been quite rewarding. In the process I have created prototypes
to represent the two architectures, learnt how to experiment and measure system metrics and
to optimise them. Further, I learned more about cloud services, pricing, agile frameworks, and
project management using management tools.
8.2 Problems Encountered and Resolution
As an amateur researcher who is investigating a topic with little previous experience, deciding
on the project topic, research methodology and how to conduct thorough investigation has
certainly been a great challenge. I had to work on the project topic several times to get it
narrowed, spent considerable days looking for available industrial data for investigation, which
was difficult to find, and with guidance from the supervisor, had to create own prototypes to
experiment and obtain the data for analysis.
8.3 Lessons Learnt
The following lessons have been learned:
- Research project is like a full-time work and requires dedication and commitment


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
52
- The supervisor will guide and direct on what need to be done, but the student has to
cooperate and be self-motivated
- The work can be frustrating, so having a topic one is interested in, with benefit in sight
is very important to keep one going when faced with discouragements
- Research work helps us learn new skills and improve on what is already known. I have
learned from the knowledge of others on the topic area and added my little discoveries
to it.
- Most importantly, I have gained valuable industrial experience on monolith and
microservices architecture that will help in current work and future prospects.
8.4 What could have been done better or differently
The experience would have been quite interesting and enriching, with much better results if I
had the opportunity to visit some IT companies, like Gartner, Amazon Web Services or Google,
and experimented with large systems. It also could have provided an opportunity to interview
and gain perspectives in real time.

Final Project Proposal
1. Topic of Investigation:
Reviewing the Scope and Impact of Implementing a Modernised IT Event-Driven
Architecture from Traditional Architecture using Agile Frameworks – A Case study
of Bi-modal operational strategy
1.1 Problem Statement:
Many business enterprises and companies that adopt IT as critical part of their daily
operations still depend on traditional or legacy architecture software although most of
the components are becoming obsolete and incur about 80 percent of the IT
department’s operational costs (Newman, 2017). Also, such businesses and
companies find it difficult to apply modern IT practices such as Agile frameworks as it
is difficult for a team of developers to work collaboratively on a traditional, legacy or
monolith architected software, thereby making maintenance even more difficult.
Salescache, an online discounts shop is one example of several companies
whose enterprise system was build using the monolith approach. It resulted in
the system being tightly coupled and so making it difficult to maintain, and the

entire system needing to be rebuilt using the event-driven architecture
framework. However, findings show that many companies are sceptical in
migrating to the event-driven microservices, not because they don't embrace
the new technology and the benefit agility offers, but because they don't
understand how to migrate while ensuring little or no disruption to the old
system (Purcell, 2017). There is also the problem of financial aspects of
migrating to microservices. Managed services in public cloud platforms have
very different pricing models, and the choice of a microservice runtime or data
storage solution can have a significant impact on the cost-effectiveness of
running a microservice system in the cloud. A price study comparing the costs
for running microservice with different cloud platform managed services would
help architects and enterprise companies in choosing architectural patterns
also with cost-effectiveness in mind. These issues inspired this research work
to attempt and investigate the efficiency of event-driven architecture compared
to the traditional architecture, analyse the scope and impact of migrating, and
the benefits agile adoption will have on such enterprises.
1.2 Research Objectives:
vi. A review of Traditional Legacy Architecture and cost of IT maintenance,
upgrade and modernisation
vii. A review of Market adoption of Event-driven Architectures, Trends, Failures
and Successes. A case study of Netflix
viii. Analysis of Agile Frameworks in the Transformation from Traditional
Legacy Architecture to Event-driven Architecture
ix. Benefits of Agile Adoption in IT Modernisation when implementing Event
driven Architecture to replace Monolithic Cyber Complex and Enterprise
Systems
x. Operationalisation of Event-driven architecture using Bi-Model Strategy in
decommissioning systems with Traditional Legacy Architecture
1.3 Intended Users:


7048CEM Research Project 2020 Event-driven Architecture using Agile Frameworks
72
i. The academic community: At the end of this project, we expect to have more
in-depth knowledge of various event-driven architectures currently available
and determine the preferred architecture for enterprise systems.
ii. Software developers aiming to use the event-driven architecture in their
practices: Encourage painless use of agility as collaborating teams will be
dealing with separate modules that are highly independent and loosely
coupled.
iii. Salescache: the report may help the company know how to maintain their
system going forward, as well as make the best choice of architecture in their
future developments.
iv. Career progression
2. System Requirements, Project Deliverables and Final Project Outcome
System Requirement
i. RapidMiner studio for the impact-cost analysis of different cloud service
platforms
ii. Microsoft Excel as database for data to be analysed with rapidMiner
iii. VisualParadigm to design some architectural diagrams
Project Deliverables
i. Gathering data, processing the data, analysing and discussions of findings of
the impact-cost analysis of financial involvement using different cloud service
platforms
ii. Recommending the best cost-effective platforms for enterprise adoption
Final Project Outcome
The outcome will be the analysis results, benefits of agile adoption using event-driven
architecture for enterprises, and recommending best practices.
