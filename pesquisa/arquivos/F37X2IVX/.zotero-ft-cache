THE NEED FOR
Executive Summary
Even a small improvement to mobile speed can have a positive effect on business results
for brands.
Over a 4 week period, we analysed mobile site data from 37 retail, travel, luxury and lead
generation brands across Europe and the US. Results showed that a mere 0.1s change in
load time can influence every step of the user journey, ultimately increasing conversion rates.
Conversions grew by 8% for retail sites and by 10% for Travel sites on average.
With a 0.1s improvement in site speed, we observed that retail consumers spent almost 10%
more, while lead generation and luxury consumers engaged more, with page views increasing by
7% and 8% respectively.
The rise of customer expectations and increasing use of smartphones are amplifying the need
for mobile speed. The competitive gap will widen between brands who provide great mobile
experience and those who don’t.


4
To stay ahead, brands need to make site speed a priority across the organisation. They should
adopt a mobile-first mind-set; introducing the right processes and allocating resources to
constantly monitor and optimise their site speed.
The study findings are intended to provide new evidence that speed does matter and help
brands to prioritise it as a key performance metric.

We observed the following key improvements to engagement and conversion

Rising Expectations
in the Mobile-First
World
Today’s consumer is always on the go, has limited patience and expects a more tailored,
in–context experience.
People rely on mobile constantly in their daily lives, with almost a third of the UK working
population – 10.4 million people – using smartphones to be more productive at work (1). A study
by Boston Consulting Group emphasised this reliance and revealed that people would not be
willing to surrender their mobile devices, even at the expense of satisfying some traditional
needs.(2)


8
More than 3 in 10 consumers would stop seeing their friends in person
A third of people would rather give up sex for a year
45% say they would put off going on holiday
46% would be willing to give up a day off per week
More than 55% would rather give up dining out for 12 months
Even though these findings don’t directly apply to mobile-based engagement or sales, it is
interesting to see how mobile-centric psychology is changing.
Speed has a direct impact on user experience. Speed plays a vital role in the success of any
digital initiative, and is pronounced on e-commerce and other transactional sites. 70% of
consumers admit that page speed impacts their willingness to buy from an online retailer (3) and
in the US, latency is the number one reason why consumers decide to abandon mobile sites (4),
with 10% blaming slow downloads as a reason for not purchasing (5).
The need for mobile speed
Boston Consulting Group
Google’s user performance data shows that even the smallest fraction of a second in page load
can change customer focus and interaction.
Users are exceptionally good at tracking motion, and they dislike it when animations aren't smooth. They perceive animations as smooth so long as 60 new frames are rendered every second. That's 16ms per frame, including the time it takes for the browser to paint the new frame to the screen, leaving an app about 10ms to produce a frame.
Respond to user actions within this time window and users feel like the result is immediate. Any longer, and the connection between action and reaction is broken.
Users experience a slight perceptible delay.
Within this window, things feel part of a natural and continuous progression of tasks. For most users on the web, loading pages or changing views represents a task.
Beyond 1000 milliseconds (1 second), users lose focus on the task they are performing.
Beyond 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds), users are frustrated and are likely to abandon tasks. They may or may not come back later.

Which actions do you take when an e-commerce site loads slower than expected?
There is evidence that site speed improvements can have an impact on customer engagement,
conversions and ultimately a brand’s bottom line. If we include positive shifts in loyalty, brand
perception and advocacy in the mix, we can see that investing in speed is one of the key
ingredients that leads to a brand’s online success.

A 2019 study ran by Google in Denmark, demonstrated that on average consumers were
10% more willing to recommend a web shop if load-time was reduced from 13 seconds to 10
seconds. A further reduction from 10 seconds to 3 seconds gave an estimated 26% increase in
advocacy. (6)
The study concluded significant potential for increasing consumer loyalty and therefore revenue
by optimising mobile website speed. And the slower the website, the bigger the potential. It gets
more interesting when we see the direct impact mobile site speed has on likelihood to bounce.

Consumers are now mobile-first
Mobile is asserting itself as the dominant digital touchpoint, influencing both online sales and
purchase decisions in-store. This influence will continue to deepen and it is estimated that
mCommerce will double from 2019–2023, ultimately accounting for 3⁄4 of total e-commerce
sales (7). There is still a way to go though as retailers see 45% lower conversion rates on mobile
devices than on desktop(8)
Smartphones are important to every phase of the purchase journey, from discovery to price
checking, however comfort when browsing on mobile is still much higher than the likelihood to
purchase. When it comes to mobile transactions, the UK leads the pack; 25% of UK adults who
purchase physical goods prefer using a smartphone. (9)
The poor performance of marketers’ mobile websites, including slow page load times, continues to be an issue and is conditioning people to navigate away before they even see the content or products they want.

Rising consumer expectations
Consumer expectations have risen dramatically in the last decade, and will continue to do so.
In response, consumer-centricity continues to evolve as one of the most critical and influential
business principles. Competition, technology and the evolution of digital channels are amongst
the key drivers, however, arguably the main catalyst has been the increase in consumer
expectations, or rather the decrease in tolerance of a mediocre experience.
In response to an increasingly savvy mobile-first consumer, brands need to prioritise their
mobile channels. They need to embrace mobile strategically, tactically and culturally if they want
to acquire and retain consumers over the long term.

Salesforce Resarch – State of the Connected Customer 3rd Edition
Most brands are aware that consumer loyalty can be fragile. It has never been easier for a
consumer to abandon in favour of a more personalised customer service, an app with higher
self-service utility value, and crucially, a better mobile experience.
Products alone no longer guarantees consumer loyalty. Consumers often consider the
experience a brand offers to be its main differentiator.
In today’s always-on culture, the hunger for instant gratification and the need for smooth self
service will continue to motivate brands to invest in optimising their end-to-end ecosystems. In
short, consumers have a priority for great experiences.
They want satisfying browsing and content consumption, simple paths to purchase and lots of
credible help when faced with a barrier in their journey. The crucial piece is that they want all of
this quicker.
The need for speed is more than tantamount to the need for a great experience. It is the driver.
This means that the emphasis on minimising latency in mobile performance is only going to
deepen in 2020 and beyond.

Site Speed
Study In Detail
The purpose of this study is to isolate speed as a performance metric and to observe how it
effected browsing and conversion behaviour, specifically for mobile sites.
The findings are based on real data from 37 brands accounting for 30m user sessions over a 4
week period. Participating brands were from retail, luxury, travel and lead generation verticals,
primarily from Europe and the US.
In the context of this study a brand was categorised as part of the lead generation vertical if the
purpose of its website was to generate leads (i.e. get users to fill in a form - for example, to ask
for an insurance quote) which could then turn into conversions (i.e. purchasing an insurance
plan) online/offline.

The key steps and page types in the retail conversion journey are shown below. Two journeys
were analysed; (a) a simple one-step check out and (b) a two-step check out
Improving site speed observed

on mobile devices.
Consumers were most
sensitive to speed when
moving from product detail

improvement in the 4 site
speed metrics.
Average order value increased

16
Funnel Progression Rate
Speed on product pages is vital. An increase of 3.2% was observed from product listing page
to product detail page, and a 9.1% increase when progressing to add to basket. This results in
consumers, on average, spending 9.2% more on mobile.
By splitting the funnel into pre and post checkout engagement we see most improvement
during pre-checkout phase, when consumers are exploring product options and content.
The observed improvement reduces to just 1% when consumers proceed to basket. We saw
a negative effect of speed improvement on homepage to product listing page progression.
Although counter-intuitive, this can sometimes be explained by people clicking more on promo
banners when they load faster rather than jumping into a product category.
In retail, it is often more important to focus on the load times of your product detail page
instead of your homepage. This is because many people visiting your homepage are already
loyal to your brand while those going straight to the product page might be coming from an ad
they click while searching for this item on multiple sites. It will be easy for them to bounce and
go to a competitor if your site doesn’t load quickly enough.

Arguably, the most critical part of the journey is within the checkout environment. Consumers
are sensitive to a 0.1s speed increase in both one click and two click scenarios. Overall, we
observe least influence when progressing from basket to order to checkout in both journeys.
The accompanying percentages beside each stage represent the increase (or decrease) in progression along the funnel based on all four speed metrics improving their speed by 0.1s

When site speed improved 0.1 sec we observed a positive correlation in consumers viewing
more pages per session, transacting more and spending more. The data also showed a positive
correlation between speed improvement and potentially the most important KPI - average order
value. On average, users spent 9.2% more on mobile.

Funnel Progression Rate
Even though site speed had the least positive influence on funnel progression when analysed,
travel consumers were less sensitive than retail. Progression uplift can be seen incrementally
throughout the funnel, culminating in a 2.2% increase in form completion to form submission.
A 2% increase was identified in the add ons/form step 1 to form step 2, where travellers are
configuring their trips i.e. adding speedy boarding, selecting plane seats or purchasing car hire.
We should be mindful that travel journeys are typically less flexible than retail journeys, meaning
that users are more than likely to have a specific need to satisfy within a certain time window i.e.
“I need to travel to Madrid for a conference between 10th – 13th July”. The availability of travel
‘solutions’ is typically rather finite and as such users have a higher degree of patience when
progressing through the funnel. In retail, for example, it is much easier to abandon and buy from
an alternative brand.
Travel configuration can often be a clunky and frustrating experience due to extremely long
pages, multiple options and the constant push to cross and upsell. Increasing site speed may
reduce user’s cognitive load and encourage progression to the next stage in the funnel.

Simpler mobile experiences on travel sites can make it easier for users to make choices when
given multiple options. Furthermore, a faster loading site drives conversion rates up.
Mobile traffic is growing in the Travel sector but conversion rates are way behind due to
consumers preferring the security and accuracy of finalising their experience. However they need
to be aware that there is a lot of cross-device behaviour when consumers are researching and
comparing, prior to purchase.
By improving site speed by 0.1s, users were observed to transact, spend more and visit
more pages per session. The most substantial gain from site speed improvements is in the
conversions.

Luxury
Out of all verticals studied, luxury consumers are
the most sensitive to speed improvements.
An improvement in speed correlates with longer
sessions and an increased likelihood to convert
for mobile users.
There was a highly significant 40.1% increase
in users moving from product detail to add to
basket.
Bounce rate on product listing page for desktop
users increased by 4.8%, yet decreased by 3.8%
for those on mobile.
Key Findings
Consumers were the most sensitive
to speed in the latter stages of the
conversion journey.
These findings are based on 2.1m user sessions with an improvement of 0.1s of each of the four
speed metrics explained in the methodology section


22
Within the homepage to add to basket journey we can see an incremental progression increase
of 4% from the homepage to product listing page, and an impressive 40.1% when adding
to basket. There was also a significant uplift in the shorter contact us journey, with a 0.1s
improvement correlating with a 20.6% uplift. Clearly, speed matters most in the latter stages of
the luxury funnel.

It needs to be noted that luxury consumers will often use the add to basket functionality as a
wish list, so progression to the basket does not necessarily equate to all items being purchased,
and overall progression rate beyond product detail page is very small.

Journey 1
With high-value purchases, consumers are sometimes reticent to complete transactions online
and prefer to make an appointment and buy-in-store. Two user journeys were analysed within
the luxury vertical to reflect typical conversion behaviours.

Some UX studies show that many luxury brands struggle with on-site conversion rates and as
such are making a concerted effort to become more digitally progressive. The key takeaway for
these brands is that their consumers are more sensitive to speed improvements than any of the
other verticals analysed in the study.

Luxury consumers typically spend more time perusing and comparing product content during

higher value products and also the exclusivity of the purchase.

Luxury brands want to give the best experience to their consumers everywhere, including on
their websites, even if online sales make up a fraction of their revenue. These brands are very
attentive to their website experience but often have strict brand guidelines they would not
sacrifice even if they contradict good practices of speed or UX - like certain fonts, colours and
layouts. The “usual suspects” slowing down these sites are high-resolution imagery and video
content, as well as 3rd party tags and an overall unoptimised structure of the site.


24
Lead Generation
A site speed improvement of 0.1s observed an
uplift of 21.6% from the first step of the form to
the form submission page.
Bounce rate on mobile decreased by 8.3%, yet
increased by 3.4% on desktop.
A 6.7% increase in sessions was observed when
page speed improved.
Conversion rates on both mobile and desktop
decreased when site speed was seen to improve.
Key Findings
Consumer engagement and likelihood to
convert were most effected by site speed.
Conversion Journey
Similar to luxury brands, a lot of lead generation brands want to steer consumers towards an
offline meeting with the brand representative, where most of the sale will happen. This means
they are not as focussed on providing the best and fully functional mobile experience, but
instead they want to get as much information on the customer and their needs upfront as is
possible to make the first conversation productive. As a result, conversion funnels are typically
much shorter and simpler than in retail and travel contexts.
In the context of lead generation, an Informational page is essentially any page on the website
other than the homepage, checkout and form pages. It is a page whose purpose is to inform the
potential customer about the products/services offered.
These findings are based on 505k user sessions with an improvement of 0.1s of each of the four
speed metrics explained in the methodology section


25
While speed had a positive influence on funnel progression in both journeys, the biggest change
was seen in the more typical conversion scenario where users submitted a contact form. There
was a substantial uplift of 21.6% when progressing from form step 1 to form submission.

Homepage and informational pages both benefitted from a reduced bounce rate when page
speed increased.
Companies in finance and insurance sectors with lead generation sites tend to be quite
traditional in their culture, with site updates happening rarely, maybe every 1.5-2 years.
Newcomers to the industry are changing the game which will ultimately increase pressure for
longer players to invest more in their mobile experience.

CHALLENGE
APPROACH
JÖRG POGGENPOHL,GLOBAL HEAD DIGITAL MARKETING AT BMW GROUP, MAY 2019
The BMW website didn’t look, feel, or behave like a website built by
BMW, where our brand is synonymous with performance. With speed.
So we decided to rebuild our mobile website from scratch, to create a
mobile site experience that would reflect what BMW represents. We
had four goals for the new site. The first goal was speed. The second
and third goals? Speed. Our fourth goal was to leverage our consumer
insights to create a dynamic and resourceful marketing outlet.
As a performance automobile company, we know well at BMW that
building great products starts with choosing the right components.
To create a best-in-class website built for speed and great user
experiences, we chose Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and Accelerated
Mobile Pages (AMP).
PWAs are reliable and load instantly, even in uncertain network
conditions, and provide an engaging, immersive, app-like user
experience on mobile devices. And AMP’s open source initiative was
designed to create webpages that load quickly on mobile browsers.
As an added bonus, because the AMP framework is constantly being
updated to ensure it’s reliable, we don’t need to spend ongoing
developer resources to ensure it stays fast.
Before the first line of code was written,
our creative and design teams agreed
to abandon any feature that would
slow down the site.
“


29
RESULTS
The result was a mobile site that serves as the perfect vehicle for
the kind of content that embodies what the BMW brand is all about:
design, innovation, and performance. We were very happy with the
look and feel of the new site. It’s fast, beautiful, informative, engaging
— everything we wanted it to be. We rebuilt our mobile site with the
expectation that it would improve performance. And the results we
saw far exceeded our expectations.

Pfizer
CASE STUDY
CHALLENGE
APPROACH
RISA WEXLER, HEAD OF PFIZER’S MEDIA LAB, FEBRUARY 2019
The challenge at Pfizer was the same as every company operating
today: navigating how they do business in a world that’s moving at
breakneck speed.
With around 40 promoted brands, and 12 to 15 operating full-throttle
sites with lots of functionality at any one time, they were seeing similar
mobile speed problems across the whole portfolio. The sites weren’t
fast, weren’t accessible, and didn’t offer great experiences. One of their
sites took 21 seconds to fully load!
They needed a strategy to fix that, but first, they had to get Senior
Leaders and Marketers on board with this change. After reviewing their
portfolio of sites with Google they realised they needed to do better for
patients. They needed to rebuild their mobile experience.
Pfizer introduced the idea of setting a “speed budget,” the amount
of time they would accept for a site to load. Any new images or
functionality that was introduced into a site can’t blow their speed
budget. Pfizer was ruthless with this, and often it meant something else
would have to go.
They also developed a new generic site infrastructure so we could
adapt and scale quickly for each brand. And it worked: The site that
took 21 seconds to fully load? Now it takes 5.2 seconds.
Risa Wexler, Head of Pfizer’s Media Lab stated ‘Mobile is great at
helping people cut through the clutter. But that requires creating
experiences that are just for mobile. While there are similarities
between desktop and mobile, creating a mobile-responsive site for
both platforms should only be a temporary fix. It’s critical to build
for each platform so you’re providing the experience people expect,
regardless of the platform on which they seek your information’
Pfizer also kicked off their “digital wallet” initiative.


31
RESULTS
It’s their copay card version of checking in at the airport on your phone. Patients don’t need
to remember key chain tags, passwords, or which phone number to plug in where. They can
complete the whole transaction via their phone with their mobile wallet.
The Pfizer sites load 38% faster with the bounce rate reduced by 20%.
The appliance has obviously improved
conversion and revenue for us. When
you affect conversion by 9%, that is very
significant on an annual basis

In view of the highly competitive financial market in Germany, Postbank
wanted to stand out from the competition with a faster mobile website.
The aim was to determine how a higher speed affects the cost per lead
when accessing via mobile devices. On this basis, the decision about
further investments in modern web technologies would then be made.
Postbank selected a landing page with many hits. With Accelerated
Mobile Pages (AMP) , a new version of this page was created. AMP is an
open source development framework for shorter website load times.
The team created five Google Ads campaigns using designs and
tests. These A / B tests then ran over a period of 30 days. In this way,
it collected data on the performance of the different page versions:
number of leads, cost per lead, click rate, cost per click and hits.
In campaigns with general keywords,
there was a significant increase in
efficiency with AMP: 58% more leads at
a 37% lower cost per lead. The click rate
was 11% higher , the cost per click 8%
lower. Postbank achieved 8.5% more hits
overall at the same cost.

TUI
CASE STUDY
CHALLENGE
APPROACH
LINA HASSAN, CONVERSION SPECIALIST GOOGLE SWEDEN
Travel operator TUI in the Nordics undertake a large-scale overhaul
of their internal organisation and processes in order to prioritise site
speed improvement. Speed projects require structural support, and
often a whole new attitude to development. TUI in the Nordics knew
that to make the most of this opportunity for growth they needed a
fresh approach.
It’s easy to assume that fixing site speed is solely the engineers’
responsibility. But for a speed project to get off the ground, the
whole organisation needs to be on board, with dialogue between
management, stakeholders and developers, silos broken down and
agile processes put in place.
TUI found that adopting a few key premises was fundamental to their
success:
– Buy-in from management, all the way up to CEO Alex Huber.
– Establishing cross-functional teams, allowing for dialogue between
business representatives and developers.
– Welcoming a test-and-learn mindset.
For a speed project to really take off, the management mindset needs
to be forward-thinking and adaptable, with engineers given as much
autonomy and accountability as possible. Various new development
techniques can help to facilitate this agile approach:
– Adopt a Kanban system.
– Set up mob programming where all developers work together on one
task at one screen, alternating at the keyboard.


35
Since implementing these new processes and technologies, tui.se has seen a 31%
decrease in bounce rates and a 78% reduction in load times. This is a significant
improvement: not only because speed is an important ranking factor, but because many
studies show a direct correlation between speed and conversions on both desktop and
mobile.
The TUI case demonstrates a particularly notable impact on mobile visitors, with an 11%
increase in mobile conversion rate relative to desktop. As mobile gradually becomes the
primary device, developing this area will become more and more central to growth.
– Use metrics like time to market and defect rate to prove that the new way of
working results in both quality and speed, increasing trust and support from the
business.
– Shift to a platform that allows frequent site changes, cutting release cycles and
enabling a test-and-learn culture.
RESULTS
TUI has seen
31% decrease in
bounce rates and
78% reduction in
load times
Without operational support, speed
projects often end up stuck in backlogs
- or get forgotten by the next campaign.
Fixing site speed is not only about
code. To get it right you need the right
organisational setup and mindset.

Ebay
CASE STUDY
CHALLENGE
APPROACH
ADDY OSMANI, ENG MANAGER WORKING ON CHROME AND WEB PLATFORM
Speed was a company-wide initiative for eBay in 2019, with many
teams determined to make the site and apps as fast as possible for
users. In fact, for every 100 milliseconds improvement in search page
loading time, eBay saw a 0.5% increase in “Add to Cart” count.
Through the adoption of Performance Budgets (derived after doing
a competitive study with the Chrome User Experience Report) and
a focus on key user-centric performance metrics, eBay was able to
make significant improvements to site speed.
The improvements eBay made were possible due to the reduction or
“cuts” (in the size and time) of various entities that take part in a user’s
journey. This post covers topics that are relevant to the web developer
community at large, rather than eBay-specific topics.
Reduce payload across all text resources - eBay reduced their text payloads by
trimming all the unused and unnecessary bytes of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and JSON
responses served to users.
Critical path optimization for above-the-fold content - eBay introduced the
concept of the critical path for Experience Services (service architecture layer). When
a request comes to these services, they work on getting the data for above-the-fold
content immediately, by calling other upstream services in parallel
Image optimizations - eBay standardized on the WebP image format for search
results across all platforms, including iOS, Android, and supported browsers.
Predictive prefetch of static assets - A user session on eBay is not just one page.
It is a flow. For example, the flow can be a navigation from the homepage to a search
page to an item page. So why don’t pages in the flow help each other? That is the
idea of predictive prefetch, where one page prefetches the static assets required for
the next likely page


37
Prefetching top search results - When a user searches eBay, eBay’s analytics
data suggests that it is highly likely that the user will navigate to an item in the
top 10 of the search results. So eBay now prefetches the items from search and
keeps them ready for when the user navigates.
Eager downloading of search images - eBay now immediately sends the
first 10 item images to the browser in a chunk along with the header, so the
downloads can start before the rest of the markup arrives. As a result, the images
will now appear quicker. This change is rolled out globally for the web platform
Edge caching for unrecognized homepage users - eBay decided to cache
the unrecognized user content (HTML) on their edge network (PoPs) for a short
period. First-time users can now get homepage content served from a server
near them, instead of from a faraway data center. eBay is still experimenting with
this in international markets, where it will have a bigger impact.
All the performance “cuts” eBay made collectively contributed towards
moving the needle, and it happened over a period of time. The releases
were phased in throughout the year, with each release shaving off tens of
milliseconds, ultimately reaching the point where eBay is now:

Recommendations


39
The mobile web remains the most widely used platform in a world where people have more ways
than ever before to search, browse, and shop. But it’s no longer enough to have just a mobile
presence. Business growth requires the fast mobile experience that people expect and demand
today. Speed is a foundational aspect of good user experience. Latency on mobile sites can
cause:
– A reduction in mobile sales.
– A decrease in consumer engagement.
– Increased consumer frustration and higher likelihood to bounce.
– Negative brand perception and reduced consumer advocacy.
– Increased abandonment in favour of a competitor who offers a better mobile experience.
– Loss of competitive advantage.
Recommendations
Give customers the kind of mobile experience they expect, or be prepared to watch those customers go elsewhere — and fast.
“
Think with Google


40
1. Understand the speed status: In order to choose where and how to invest in speed,
you need to know how your site is currently performing in a stand-alone context and also in
comparison to your competitors. Google have created an easy to use Test My Site Tool to
enable you to understand, measure and benchmark your mobile site speed. The lighthouse is
another useful tool which allows you to understand your site speed in the context of different
devices.
2. Be clear on the potential impact of mobile site speed on the bottom line: Being
equipped with this data will help you to sell and prove the validity of considering speed as a
primary performance metric.
3. Adopt a mobile-first strategy: Mobile-first is essentially a design strategy, more
appropriate for satisfying today’s consumers than the responsive approach. While it may use
a mobile responsive framework, it considers mobile users’ needs first and foremost.
4. Identify speed as one of the primary performance metrics: It’s essential to build
consensus to make speed a priority KPI and performance metric. Site owners, designers,
strategists, developers and suppliers need to keep speed top of mind when undertaking any
mobile site improvements or overhauls.
5. Introduce page speed budget to project teams and clients: Page speed budget or
web performance budget is a set of constraints that project teams will use to ensure the
mobile site meets performance standards and loads quickly across devices and platforms. It’s
easy for a website to grow in size with new functionalities, content and design items but it’s
essential to understand the impact on customer time and bandwidth. Performance, especially
speed, should never be compromised for an aesthetic or functional site addition.
By introducing a speed budget, the impact of each site amendment or update can be
assessed to understand the positive or negative consequence. Anything that does have a
negative consequence should be reconsidered.
6. Use the right tools in the right way: Make sure you are using the right tools for both
measurement and reporting. Your analytics package needs to be set up correctly, with a
strong focus on conversion point, funnels and appropriate KPIs.
7. Create the right culture with the right people: Nurture a performance-centric culture
where speed is considered a priority metric by leadership, strategists, developers, designers,
content practitioners and project managers.
Understand your speed status and strategy setting:
Make it happen:
Investing in mobile site speed will help unlock revenue and brand loyalty. There is no reason why
every brand providing a mobile experience can’t capitalise on these opportunities if they take
steps from cultural, strategic and tactical perspectives.


41
The reality is that speed matters. An increase in speed can lead to an increase in revenue,
advocacy, trust and brand perception. These are some of the fundamental growth pillars for all
businesses.
Now is the time for brands to be investing in mobile, especially mobile speed. In order to stay
competitive and grow, brands need to start making speed one of their priority performance
metrics, and they need to start today.

STEP 1
Methodology
A methodology was created to enable us to identify which brands would qualify for the
study, isolate vertical specific KPIs, extract site data and apply a statistical model to gain most
meaningful insights.
Brand Recruitment
Google, Deloitte Digital and Fifty-Five collectively approached over
70 brands to participate in the study. Focus verticals were retail,
luxury, travel and lead generation primarily across Europe, and
the US.


44
STEP 2
STEP 3
Brand Site Audits
KPI Framework Established
37 brands qualified for the study after passing analytics, technical and
qualitative audits.
A KPI framework mapped out all the conversion funnels and metrics to be
measured in the study. Each vertical had its own KPI framework as funnels
were different.
– Flag any technical constraints which could have disrupted user experience or distorted tracking of user behaviour.
– Analysis of how brands were tracking their main KPIs and page types on their website.
– Verification if page views were being tracked correctly.
Funnel progression rate, bounce rate, add-to-basket rate, revenue and AOV.
Funnel progression rate, bounce rate & form submissions.

– Checked for any upcoming promotions or site changes which could have affected results.
– Notification of any changes/redesign or A/B site tests during the data collection which could have impacted the study.
– Sought to understand if key metrics were properly tracked within the brand’s web analytics tool(s).
– Cross-checked revenues to ensure that conversion results were reported correctly in the web analytics tools.

Data Collection
Statistical Modelling
Identification of Key Speed Metrics
Speed data was measured via Google Lighthouse and aggregated with brands’
Web Analytics data. Approximately 4 weeks’ worth of hourly data was collected
to reach statistical significance.
To understand the impact of site speed, a logarithmic regression model was
used. Regression modelling is a statistical technique used to uncover the
relationship between a set of predictors and an outcome variable.
A logarithmic model was chosen as it allows for a multiplicative effect, allowing
us to look at the effect of % increases/decreases in site speed across a variety
of pages and website with differing speeds.
Four key speed metrics were identified as most meaningful after feeding the
data into a logarithmic regression model. These were:
When users navigate to a URL, the server receives a request and returns the contents of the page. Server latency measures the time for the server to respond to the main document request.(10)
This metric measures the time at which the user feels the primary content of the page is visible. This is essentially when the biggest above-the-fold layout change has happened, and web fonts have loaded.(12)
This is the estimated time that your pages take to respond to user input. A lighthouse value of more than 50ms may mean that users perceive your
pages as laggy.(11)
The amount of time it takes the page to load, from initiation of the pageview (e.g. click on a page link) to load
completion in the browser. (13)

STEP 7
Data Analysis and Synthesis
Once data had been collected and fed into a ogarithmic regression
model, we were in a position to analyse the data and extract meaning.
We built the logarithmic model to correlate speed with the identified KPIs
and progression rates.
Points to note:
We looked at the correlation between a 0.1s improvement in mobile page speed and
performance metrics typical for a given vertical. For progression rates we specifically
analysed page speed and for the other KPIs we analysed site speed (See further reading
section). Fluctuations in speed all occurred naturally and were not artificially created on
any of the sites.
For the study, conversions per vertical were considered as:
Retail: Number of users that transacted
Travel: Number of users that transacted
Luxury: Number of users that added to basket or clicked on ‘contact us’
Lead Generation: Number of users that completed a form.
For each coefficient, a minimum level of 95% statistical significance was required
before results were considered for analysis. Each brands’ site was impacted differently,
and by a unique combination of the four meaningful speed metrics. The four speed
metrics did not always have a significant effect on each funnel progression step or
KPI analysed. This means that the coefficient for that funnel step did not reach 95%
statistical significance
The 0.1 second improvement was the cumulative impact of all four speed metrics.

Speed Impact study - Limitations and Areas for further research
– The study managed to find statistically significant correlation between
site speed and revenue-related metrics however readers should be
mindful of the few existing limitations:
– The results of this study are based on a sample of 37 websites, which
were tested over a 4 week period. These results may not fully reflect the
Internet as a whole. Since results are aggregated by vertical, they may not
fully reflect an individual site’s product offering, design, or seasonality
– The study presents only mobile web data. We have looked also at the
correlations between site speed and site performance for desktop but
found a lot of contradicting parameters. We believe that this is due to the
differences between browsing behaviour and overall desktop users being
less sensitive to load times.
– Speed was measured with Google’s lighthouse tool which pulls
simulated lab data to isolate pure speed impact versus other influencing
factors such as connection type, devices used, etc.

Report background
The purpose of this report is to communicate the findings of a study which examined the correlation between mobile site speed and mobile site user behaviours. Site speed fluctuations were natural and not artificially controlled or induced by any party.
This report has been commissioned by Google and prepared by Deloitte Ireland LLP, based on data and statistical information provided by Fifty-Five. Fifty-Five were recruited directly by Google to collect and analyse the statistical data, from 37 brand sites, over a four week period, in relation to the impact mobile site speed has on funnel progression, bounce rates, page views, conversion rates and average order value.
Brands in the study came from retail, travel, luxury and lead generation verticals across Europe and the US.
Results of the study are based solely on the 37 brands analysed and may not fully reflect the impact of speed on sites not included in this study. Furthermore, the results are aggregated by vertical - meaning that they may not always fully reflect an individual site’s product offering, design, economics and seasonality.
The results communicated in this report are based on the accuracy of the data provided by Fifty-Five, following the 4 week assessment period from 28/10/19 to 24/11/19. Deloitte LLP did not audit nor validate this data.
The scope of Deloitte LLP’s work has been limited by the website data made available by Fifty-Five.
Methodology
1. Brand recruitment - Over 70 brands were approached to take part in the study 2. Brand audits - 37 brands qualified for the study after passing analytics, technical and qualitative audits 3. KPI framework established - A KPI framework mapped out all the conversion journeys and metrics to be measured in the study 4. Data collection - Speed data was measured via Google Lighthouse and aggregated with brands’ web analytics data 5. Statistical modelling - A Logarithmic Regression Model was used to understand the the impact of site speed 6. Identification of key speed metrics - Four key speed metrics were identified as most meaningful after feeding the data into the statistical model 7. Data analysis and synthesis - Once data had been collected and fed into a Logarithmic Regression model, we were in a position to analyse the data and extract meaning
The results published in this report are the combined effect of the four speed metrics – only considering statistically significant results for each brand. In this context, statistically significant means a direct correlation was identified. In some instances, the increase in speed was observed to have minimal or zero effect on funnel progression and/or the KPIs for the vertical. These observations were not included in the report.
