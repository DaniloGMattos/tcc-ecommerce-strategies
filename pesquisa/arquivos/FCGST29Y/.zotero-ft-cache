Abstract
User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design play a pivotal role in shaping the success of e-commerce platforms. A seamless and intuitive UX/UI can significantly enhance user engagement, reduce bounce rates, and ultimately drive conversions. This paper explores the critical aspects of UX/UI in e-commerce, supported by real-time case studies and industry examples. We discuss design principles, usability heuristics, and emerging trends that influence purchasing behaviors. Furthermore, we analyze how factors such as mobile responsiveness, accessibility, and micro-interactions contribute to overall conversion rates. The study concludes with actionable insights for optimizing e-commerce UX/UI to maximize sales and customer satisfaction.
