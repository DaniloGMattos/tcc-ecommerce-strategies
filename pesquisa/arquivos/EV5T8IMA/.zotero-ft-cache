From Clicks to Conversions: Analysis of Traffic Sources in E-Commerce
Amrutha Muralidhar, Yathindra Lakkanna
Over the past years, e-commerce platforms have expanded substantially, providing customers with convenient shopping experiences. To enhance e-commerce websites, it's essential to grasp user engagement and factors affecting conversion rates. This optimization is achieved by aligning platforms with user expectations, thereby fostering successful online shopping experiences, and contributing to sustained growth in the dynamic digital marketplace. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis focusing on user interactions, conversion metrics, and the entire user journey within an e-commerce platform. Our exploration spans exit rates and sessions across different devices and browsers, conversion rates for various traffic sources, and the user journey from product details to checkout. Findings suggest a need for targeted improvements in mobile optimization and browser compatibility, indicated by higher exit rates on mobile devices and varying rates on different browsers. The conversion rate analysis emphasizes the varying effectiveness of traffic sources, highlighting the potential of advertised mediums, while identifying areas for improvement in referral and affiliate traffic. Examining the user journey showed potential bottlenecks in the conversion process, the identified gap was between user interest and completed transactions. Our study suggests improving the checkout process strategically to streamline user transactions. These insights provide actionable guidance for businesses seeking to refine their platforms and optimize performance in the ever-evolving landscape of e-commerce.
