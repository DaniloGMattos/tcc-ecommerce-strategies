In the contemporary digital landscape, the significance of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) transcends mere visibility within search results; it extends to shaping the very essence of user experience (UX). This research delves into the profound influence exerted by SEO techniques on website performance metrics, particularly focusing on loading speeds, and their consequential impact on user engagement.The way search algorithms are always changing, with a focus on mobile-first indexing and user experience signals, highlights the mutually beneficial link that exists between SEO, website performance, and user pleasure. This paper explains how well-implemented SEO methods immediately improve website performance and foster more engaged users by closely examining and analyzing technical SEO optimisations, mobile responsiveness strategies, and UX design concepts.For both web developers and digital marketers, the research's insights provide a useful framework. It emphasizes how crucial it is to have a user-centric approach to maximize beneficial user interactions and strengthen online presence. Stakeholders may create enduring relationships with their audience and traverse the competitive digital landscape with effectiveness by giving priority to SEO techniques that improve website efficiency and increase UX standards.
